     !  The refraction index is usally a function of the wave
     !  length. If it is known, this must be given in this file: pairs
     !  of (wl, index) in each line. Wave length unit is nm.
     !  index is unitless. If dummy or blank, no file is
     !  assumed and the value given by refracIndex is used.

     !  used when wrapperReflecFile="dummy" for reflection (refMode=1)
     ! or   when wrapperRefracFile="dummy" for refraction (refMode=0)
     !      wrapperRefracFile is different from RefracFile
     !  The values specify how the each surface of the compoent is
     !   surrounded.  Normally, we don't put very thin wrapper or grease
     !   surrounding the component in the config, but we have to consider
     !   such wrapper or grease for light propagation. The values in refMode
     !   and wrapper correspond to surface # 1, 2,...  of the component
     !   in local coordinate. (i.e canonical form: .see surfaceNo.pdf):
     !   box:  #1 xy@z=0, #2 yz@x=boxa, #3 xz@y=0, #4 xz@y=boxb
     !         #5 yz@x=0, #6 xy@z=boxc.
     !   cylinder: #1 bottom, #2 top, #3 column part.
     !      If the # of surfaces is n and  less than the # of values 
     !	 given above, only first n are used. 
     !
     !  refMode: 1--> wrapper is a reflector (such as Al, Ag, white sheet..)
     !            with the reflection coeff. given by the correspoinding 
     !	       to the value in wrapper.
     !           0--> wrapper is a grease or very thin transparent material
     !	           such as clad of a fiber. It's refractive index is given
     !                in the corresponding wrapper value.
     !           -1--> no warpper; the componet is adjacent to another componet
     !	           (or void) described in congig. wrapper is not consulted.
     !              If the refraction index of that adjacent component is
     !		    0, the light is instantly  absorbed.
     !
     !  wrapper. See above.  Normally, if the value is less than 1,
     !       it should be a reflector and if it is greater than 1, it should
     !	  be a transparent thin medium. So we may live without "refMode".
     !	  But in some case, we may use 1 for both so we introduced refMode.
     !	  (For low energy X-ray, refraction index may be < 1., though
     !  we don't treat such case at present).
     !	  If the index is given, we compute the reflection or refraction 
     !	  probability  and continue the ray tracing.
     !       If the component has multi-layer clads, we should put such 
     !	  clads in config file directly with wrapper=0.
     !    If refMode is 1 and r=wrapper > 0, r-fraction of light is reflected
     !    and (1-r)-fraction of light is absorbed.
     !    If refMode is 0 and n2=wrapper> 0, reflection or refraction happenes.
     !    Their ratio is computed automaticaly using n1 and n2 and light angle
     !    and ray tracing continues.  The refracted light may enter a sencor
     !    in some case.

     !   The angle of the reflected light is dermined by this.
     !   The values correspond to the surface # as refMode or wrapper do.
     !   If mirror is 1, the reflected light has the same angle as
     !   the incident light with respect to the normal vector of the
     !   surface at the reflection point. (complete mirror reflection).
     !     It is  assumed that  (1.-"mirror") is diffusive refl. 
     !   Normally, if the wrapper is white, it is said that diffusive
     !   (random) reflection happens so that the reflection angle becomes
     !  isotropic.  Normally, mirror may be 0 or 1.
     real(8)::fuzzy(maxSurfaces) !  0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 
     !   This introduces some fuzzy factor for the reflection/refraction angle.
     !   If 0, exact Snell's law is assumed. 
     !   If > 0., it is taken as a Gaussian sprNead sigma in deg around the
     !   exact Snell's law; light angle is fuzzified by the Gaussian random
     !   factor. (Not used for diffusive reflection).

     !      no file is assumed and peakWl is used.

     real(8)::peakWL     ! 550   / 500 
     !       Effective  Wave Length (nm) of the scinti. of emitted light. 
     !      If waveLenFile is not given, this is used, but
     !      even if  waveLenFile is given, this is used for the effective
     !      wave length (peak wave length) in some case.

     real(8)::minmaxWL(2)   !  200  800 /  200 800
     !      (nm).  When a Cerekov light is emitted, its  wave length 
     !      distribution is 1/L^2 dL and short wave length light is
     !      more probable. However, short wave length light is normally
     !      instantly absorbed in the media, or the sensor may not have
     !      quantum efficiency to that light. These factors might be not
     !      well known so we may cut the light outside of this range
     !      for Cerenkov light.  For low energy charged particles,
     !      the upper limit may be automatically lowered.

     !      Used when Light=12 or 22
     !      Maximum number of photons actually traced for scinti photons
     !      generated  in a given unit cell.  If the number of photons
     !      is larger than  this, we get the final result by increasing 
     !      the result so far by a factor of RNp/NpSample, 
     !       where RNp is the total number  of photons.  
     real(8)::CellSize(3)   !  1 10 10 / 1 10 10  (let 3 values be p, q, r)
     !       When Light is 12, 21 or 22, and scintillation is to be treated
     !      (i.e, B-i=1; see manual), we store energy deposit in Edepo(:::)
     !      which corresponds to a number of cells. The unit cell size
     !      (dx,dy,dz) is determined p,q,r(%) of the component size.
     !      If the component is a box, dx = p*boxa/100, dy=q*boxb/100,
     !      dz=r*boxc/100
     !      If the component is a cylinder, dx=p*H/100, dy=q*R/100, dz=r*R/100.
     !      For example, (p,q,r)=(1,10,10), and box size (20,2,2)cm
     !      (dx,dy,dz)=(2, 2, 2) mm.  One may think 10 % is too large, but
     !      for the direction transverse to the sensor direction, normally
     !      ~10 % is OK.

     !      the scintillator's  peakWL when converting charged particle
     !      effect to the number of p.e. The charged particle's direct hit is
