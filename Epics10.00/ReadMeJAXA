#if defined Solaris 
==>
#if defined (Solaris) || (jaxa)	 || (jaxaflat)


Cosmos/cosmos/Zcondc.h
jaxa, jaxaflat added for
    MATHLOUSY 

prog/epRange.f
	parameter:: log10(..)
MATHLOUSY is applied.
	
prog/Light/epLightStack.f
	(jaxa) || (jaxaflat)
    is used for private

    sizeof cannot be used so
	use loc funciton

prog/Elemag/epdedxNone.f

#if defined (Solaris) || (jaxa) || (jaxaflat)
	use epModify,idmodiy=>id

prog/KKLib
kcubicEq.f90
   complex(kind(0d0)),parameter::w(3) = (/(1.d0,0.d0), (-1.0d0,sq3\
)/2.d0, (-1.0d0, -sq3)/2.d0 /)

  -sq3 is not acceped.  (bug for complex case ?).
  -(1.d0, sq3)/2.d0  is ok

eprcnf.f
   config file now can contain  
   #debug on  
   #debug off
(later this is changed to debug--->print)
Then, the  lines between these two lines (inclusive),
are printed on stderr.
The command must be lower character.

#debug  xx  when xx is not 'on' or 'off', or ""(blank), the line
	is regarged as comment.
        any character after 'on' or 'off' are neglected.
Besides #debug on/off, MsgLevel (in epicsfile) may be used.
If it is set to 2, all input lines are printed. 
accordingly  eprcnf is updated.

AT JAXA
With -g option, Epics can run. 

But, with -O5, error (0 div) is detected in

prog/Elemag/epSetPhotoE.f
            epphotoE.f
   intent(in), intent(out) is added for record
but this does not solve.
The error is due to that pe.cr becomes 0 in epphootE.
Although it happend in epphotoE, pe.cr is set in
epSetPhotoE so cppFCJaxa is updated to use
-g for compilation of epSetPhotoE.f

After this, 0 div disappeared.

When 100 GeV/n Fe is put, with "dpmjet3"
invalid floating operation happened in
jaminbm_ which is in jam.
(it seems rare; at 10 event generation; 26 min).
By 10 GeV/n Fe, with "jam", no happining within 15 events
    6  //                                       20

 

when making load module
-v must be dropped.
