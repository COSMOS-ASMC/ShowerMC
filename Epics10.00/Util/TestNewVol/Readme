Stuffs here are to test how the subroutines to deal with
a new volume-shape underconstruction.

Example: use
A)  testNewVol.f

   "config" file which gives a "sqtccl". 
1)   Standard routines for sqtccl must be ready
   and put in prog/NewVol and registered in
   Makefile.  Also, make should have done
   without error. (For sqtccl, this has been
   done already).
2) usenewvol  config (if not yet done)

3) make -f testNewVol.mk  to make a.out

4) ./a.out > outputfile   
5)    Then, enter "config" to specify the config file.
6)  /
   For the default. For a non default case, see 7)
Then, outputfile  will have a nubmer of lines like
  0.320768505   -1.81139994    0.651029110           1
  1.54095125     0.00000000    0.378301561           1
  1.86989129    -3.23109841    8.08304399E-02        0
  ...

In each line, first 3 show the (x,y,z) of a crossing point
of a line with the boundary of the volume; the line is
drawn from a random point placed outside (last term 1)
or in side  (last term 0) of the volume with a random direction.
The points will show a figure like PointsOnboundary.png
(blue for inside; red outside;Z <- Z+1.5 is used)

7) As an example of non default case, assume in/out test
is selected.  In this case we will get output like

3.13529158      -3.98952365       1.05389309        1           2
2.09776568      -7.22074175       1.02343333        1           2
1.49279261      -2.22841311      0.750308692        0           1
2.59566379      -4.12865305      0.831804454        1           2

3 terms are (x,y,z) followed by an integer 0 or 1: 0 means
  the point is jugded as inside, and 1 outside. next integer (1 or 2)
  indicates component # the point is in.  Outside case gives
  a number (# of components + 1). In side case gives the
  component #.  In this case, only one component is given for test,
  so  two integer combination should be only
  0  1
  and
  1  2.

If we plot outside points, it will be like fig. OutsidePoints.png
No points should exist inside of the volume.


B) testNewVol2.f
 This case is for detailed investigation when a line from
a  given point with  given direction cosines has a
problem of getting a  crossing point with the  volume.

We must prepare   point x,y,z values and direction
cosines  beside the config.
The example is for octagon which is indicated
by
 call epsoctagon(Det%cmp(Cn), cTrack%pos, icon).

This is to test that a given point is inside or
not.
After that boundary serach is tried moving the
point by order of epsilon.
