To test sampling of aribitrary density function given in the form of
table of (x,dn/dx) in each line.
The table must contain #------------------- line. (separator)
Any comment lines  may be placed before the separator.

1) make   
2) ./sampAFxxx  n filename > funcxy	
   where n is 0 or < 0.  
   if 0, a number of (x,dn/dx, dn/dx/Area) are put into "funcxy".
	the nubmer of lines is 5*(input data points).
   if<0, # of points will be |n|
   You will see the xmin, xmax, and max pos max func value and <x>
   on stderr.
3) ./sampAFxxx  n filename | histograming 
   n > 0.  gives n sampled variables. You may get histogram
   from this.  If it is normalized by the n, you can directly
   compare the histogram and funcxy (use dn/dx/Area as y)
   You will see the xmin, xmax, and max pos , max func value and 
   <x>   on stderr, too.
