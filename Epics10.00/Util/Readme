A) Gencol/
   To see / generate hadronic interaction events.
   See Readme there.
B) Elemag/BremPair.
   B-1) To make data for sampling ele-mag process (Brems/pair etc )
       (also for muon:  brems, pair, hadronic interaction)
   B-2) To test brems/pair sampling results and compare them
        with the functions.
   B-3) To draw only brem/pair functions at verious energies.
   B-4) For other ele-mag process such as comption, see
        subdirectory in Elemag/
C) Anime/
   To make animation of time development of cascade showers.
D) TestNewVol/
   When a new volume-shape is made, test can be done here.
     

1) DrawConf/drawConfig.f
   Used to convert a 'config' to make stuff for display by
   Geomview or Gnuplot.
   The user may invoke the
      drawconfig
   command for a given "config_path" like
     "drawconfig config_path".
   This will prepare for the display.  Actual display is by the
     dispconfigbygeomv or dispconfigbygnupl command.
  ** special for honeycomb drawing.
     To draw all of the honeycomb structure sometimes results
     in error: too many vertexes in a component, and/or time consuming
     job. So, in defalut, the central part of the honeycomb drawing is
     simplified. The region for such central part can be controled
     by Util/DrawConf/Data/honeycomb.dat.
     
     
2) testCnf1.f
   Used to expand a given config.  It is used by the command
   expand "config_path" > output_file
   
3) testCnf2.f
   This is used to show Emin for each config component.
   (AutoEmin case).
   You have to come here to use this;
   you need config file and epicsfile.
   It's better to make links like
   (after  rm existing links)    
     ln -s  config_in_target_place  config
     ln -s  CnfgDir_in_target_placd  CnfgDir
     (say, if "config" needs CnfgDir in target_palce)
     ln -s  epicsfile_in_target_place  epicsfile

  Then,
  a) If config uses #news specifications, do
       usenewvol config
  b) make -f testCnf2.mk to  make "a.out"       
  c) Then enter next 3 lines
     ./a.out > outputfile     
     config
     epicsfile
4) testCnf3.f
   This is used to show quenching info.  for scintillators.
   You have to come here to use this;
   you need config file and epicsfile.
   The same procedure for link, compilation and execution
   as in 3), except for
  make -f testCnf3.mk in stead of    make -f testCnf2.mk.
  The output will have lines like below:
    2309 6 box SCIN 1 2 0 0 / -19.2715 -22.5 0.7005 3.2 45 1
    # quench info: T    8.00       0.360
