How to utilize SRIM data for heavy ion dE/dx
1) Use "SRIM"  to get Ekt vs dE/dx  for heavy ion and given target.
   (Ekt is the total kinetic energy, i.e not K.E/E). 
   The energy region may be 0.001 GeV/n to 0.7 GeV/n
   (there may be a way to use the batch mode; I don't know how to do)
   The output name must be Zx-Media.srim  x=1~9 or 10~90 for heavy ion 
   charge, Media is SCIN etc expressing Epics media name.
   To use the data in Epics,  Z=2 (He) must be included, even if He is not
   used  in actual simlation.
2) Use convSrim.sh  
    Usage: ./convSrim.sh Name forWhat ouputdir
       Name: media name such as SCIN
       forWhat:  1 --> for betagamma vs  dE/dx/Z**2
                 2 --> for Epics use  Ek vs dE/dx 
       outputDir;  output file is put there; name will be srim.01
                  srim.02    where 01 02 is the Z.
                  For Epics, you must have created 
	            $EPICSTOP/Data/Media/SCIN_srim 
                  directory (in the case of SCIN)
                  (Note:  SciFi_srim is the link to SCIN_srim)
