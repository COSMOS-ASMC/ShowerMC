   mu   -> mu + (gamma, e+e-pair, hadrons)
   Emu -->Em' +   Eo
   k = Eo/(Em-Mmu)
   
1) To test muon brems. sampling and brems function
   a) Go to Brems
   b) ./testMuBrSamp.sh
         will tell you the usage
2) To test muon pair creation (pair creation by muons)
   a) Go to Pair
   b) ./testMuPrSamp.sh will tell you the usage.
3) To test muon nuclear interaction
   a) Go to NucI
   b) ./testMuNiSamp.sh
       will tell you the usage.

The input muon energy  must be > 10 GeV or so.
   (fo N.I, much larger).
For small energies, no graph will be shown.  (error
message will be shown).

In all cases, data and graphs in .png will be stored
in /tmp/$USER/Work
