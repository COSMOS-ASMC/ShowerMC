0-a)  
  You have to setup an environmental variable
  
       GEOMVIEW
 
  which must show the pass to the Geomview executable binary.

  For example, 
   setenv GEOMVIEW /usr/bin/geomview             (probably for Linux, etc)
 or
   setenv GEOMVIEW /usr/local/Apps/Geomview.app/Geomview  (probably for nextstep)
 etc.
0-b) Too see particle tracks (trace information), you have to
   fix 'vdir' in 'disptracebygeomv' file in this directory.  Its default is
   /tmp/$USER/Work.   Also you may
   adjust particle code list to be displayed by 'set ptcls'.

----------------
1)  To see the detector configuration,  first you have to use
    Util/drawconfig.  Fix the display conditions and select menu
    Then, issue,
 
     ./dispconfigbygeomv
 
or 
  
     ./dispconfigbygeomv -e

or 

     ./dispconfigbygeomv -a

  In most of the cases, this will be enough for you.  

If -e is given, detector display is made by component base
(you can access every component in Geomview display, but
 if the number of components becomes too large, you will
 feel subdetector base display (without -e) is more
 convienent; without -e, only level 0~1 components
 (and subdetectors) are fed to Geomview.
if -a is given, all components are put in a file so
that Geomview access the only one whole detector.

   
For other options, type 

	./dispconfigbygeomv -h

2) To know the color and media correspondence in detector display,
   you may type

  ./showmediacolor

*****NOTE******
 A perl script 'hvectext' must exist for this.  The pass to it must be
 given in an environmental variable

    GEOMVIEWTEXT 

 For example;
   /usr/bin/hvectext  (prob. for Linux)

   /usr/local/Apps/GEOMVIEW.app/bin/next/hvectext  (prob. for NEXTSTEP)


3) You can combine 1) and 2) above as

  ./dispconfigbygeomv -i.
or
  ./dispconfigbygeomv -e -i
or
  ./dispconfigbygeomv -a -i

4) You can specify the working directory to store display data, and config 
   files  explicitly as

  ./dispconfigbygeomv [-e] [-i] workdir config1 config2 ...

------------


5) To see particle trace, 
 5-1) If a trace data (say, /tmp/foo/trace1) by Epics is available
   use
   ./disptracebygeomv  /tmp/foo/trace1

  This will create ptcl2p1.vect, ptcl3n1.vect. ptcl6p1.vect etc
  (some may be missing if there is no such particle trakcs) in $vdir.

  ptcl2p1.vect containes data for particle code 2 with positive charge
 (i.e., positron)  and ptcl2n1.vect for negative charge (i.e, electron).
  For neutral particles (say, gamma rays), ptcl1z1.vect will be
  created (z for zero charge).

  You can control the charge of particles as

	./disptracebygeomv  [-{c|z|b}] /tmp/foo/trace1

  where -c is for charged particle selection, -z for zero charge particle 
  selection, -b for the both.  The default is -c.



 5-2) To display trace and detector configuration together,
     use
	
	./disptracebygeomv  [-{c|z|b}] /tmp/foo/trace1 det [-e|-a][-i] [outdir]

     where -e,-a -i and outdir are the same as for dispconfigbygeomv.


6) The 'colortab' in this directory determines the default color of 
   each particle code. Color can be changed within Geomview.
