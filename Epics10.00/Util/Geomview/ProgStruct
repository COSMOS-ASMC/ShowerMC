For  each config.XX
	find the vertex of the same component
		if it is full box, make OFF object
	else
		make CMESH object
and accumulate them in allobj.list

if component base display, 
	decompose allobj.list into component .list  file
	and remove  allojb.list
else subdetector base
	deomppose allobj.lsit into component .list and subdetector .list files
	and remove  allojb.list
else all in one base

Then display all .list files.

	  yes--> display  Work/mediatext

	fix output directory (Work)
	
	rm ^temp file if any
	rm Work/*.mesh if any

	rm Work/*.off  if any

	For given config.* or Work/config.*

	  call dispconfigbygeomv2; with say, Work, config.BGO colormap
	  call showmediacolor2

	this creates  *.list files

	examine *.list and find max and min  subdetector index.

	subdetector index > 0  && compbase ?
	   yes --> rm listofnonsubd
		examine each of *.list and find non-subdetector
		and put it in listofnonsubd 

		do each of subdetector  index
		 examine each of *.list and find subdetectors
	         and make listfile to contain a name like,
		 subd_bgosubd_6.list
		 listifle != ' ' ?
		   yes--> call geomviewconfig3.awk and
			 make Work/$listfile to contain
			 corresponding subdetector components
-----------------	
dispconfigbygeomv2
	fix color by media and colormap
	
	call geomviewconfig1.awk with colorinfo, config.BGO
	  and put output in temp$$ which consists of  CMESH 

	call geomviewconfig2.awk and decompse temp$$ into mesh files.

	examine each mesh file and make list file by gathering
	the same component.

	rm temp$$
-------------------
geomveiewconfig1.awk
	recognize 2 line mesh structure and
	write  as CMESH data


---------------
geomviewconfig2.awk
	count CMESH and number them and make file name, like,
	BGO_00101.mesh. then output the content into it.


-------------
geomviewconfig3.awk
	print LIST
