To make the interface routine 'epNewVolume.f' in the prog/ directory,

1) Make a config file which containes lines like,

       #news  new-1 xxxx
       #news  new-3 yyyy

as many as you need, where xxxx, yyyy, etc is a name to
represent new volume shape. (< 9 characters).

2) Issue,

   ./mkNewVolume  configfile

where 'configfile' is the path to the config file mentioned above.

You must make routines

	epbxxxx, epsxxxx, epenvlpxxxx, eprxxxx epthickxxxx

etc as described in the manual and place them in UserHook 
and modify your Makefile so that they can be compliled by make.

(For the ep_cone.f, ep_ecyl.f, ep_cap.f, they are placed in
the prog directory and you may use it without making Makefile
for them.)
