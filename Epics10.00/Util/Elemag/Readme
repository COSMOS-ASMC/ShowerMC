1) To test brems sampling and compare it with the brems function,
   goto BremPair and
	make clean
       ./testBremSamp.sh  media events E1 E2 step [LPMeffect Flpm logx func]
 where
	media: such as Fe BGO Air Air*0.1
	events: # of events (samplings) for each energy
	E1 E2: kinetic energy of electron; form E1 to at least E2
	step:  log10 step of energy
	LPMeffec: t or f for LPM effect; default is t
  For more details, use the command without arguments.
        ./testBremSamp.sh 

   You can see gnuplot display for each energy.  The y-axis is prog/r.l 
	 To see next graph,   click the window.
	 To make it slide show, you may modify
	  brems.gp:(pause mouse => pause 2 etc )
   The command also save png figures in Work/ as brems1.png etc.
   The size may be changed by modifying brems.gp (see it's last part).

2) To test pair sampling and compare it with the pair funtion,
   goto BremPair and
	make clean
        ./testPairSamp.sh  media events E1 E2 step [LPMeffect func]
 where
	media: such as Fe BGO Air ...
	events: # of events (samplings) for ehac energy
	E1 E2: kinetic energy of electron; form E1 to at least E2
	step:  log10 step of energy
	LPMeffect: t or f for LPM effect; default is t
	func:  Pair func by Tsai-->1; by Nelson-->2(default is 2)
   Others are the same as brems case.

3)  To draw brems functions for different energies in a page,
   goto BremPair and
        ./showBremFunc.sh  media func how E1 E2 step [norm
           LPMeffect Flpm logx xmin linew linet ]
    For details, use the command without arguments.

4)  To draw pair functions for different energies in a page,
   goto BremPair and
    ./showPairFunc.sh  media  E1 E2 step [norm func]
    For details, use the command without arguments.

5) To create a sampling table for a given medium;
   goto BremPair and
	The basic media file such as Epics/Data/BaseM/Pb
	must be prepared.
	Then,
	make clean
	./CreateTab basic_media_table output_table_dir
 where
	basic_media_table: such as ../../../Data/BaseM/Pb
	output_table_dir:  such as ../../../Data/Media
  To test the result, use 1) and 2).

6) To make a sampling table for a given  media without
   vervose mode (i.e, use only defautl values).
      goto BremPair and
	make clean
	./AutoCreateTab basic_media_table output_table_dir
7) To make a sampling talbe for all media in some directory
	do e.g,
  goto BremPair and
	make clean
	bash (if your shell is not bash)

        ./AutoCreateTab.sh  dir  

         dir:   ouput directory such as /tmp/$USER/Media   
8) To get total x-section (integrated x-section) of
   Brems (integration of ds/dk from kmin to kmax~1)
 goto BremPair and
   use
   
       InteBrems.sh  
9) To get total x-section (integrated x-section) of
   pair creation,
 goto BremPair and 
   use
       IntePair.sh
