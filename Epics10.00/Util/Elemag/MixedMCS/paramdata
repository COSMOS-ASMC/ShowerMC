Data above is for 
c1forHardScat, maxHCSmfprl, print_redpdfc1

c1forHardScat: (D=0.1)  hard Coulomb scattering mfp (lHard) should
                be Lambmda(1)*c1forHardScat 
		If it is < Lambda(el), Lambda(el) is employed

         Lambda(1) is the 1st tranport mfp  
	 Lambda(el) is the elastic Coulomb scattering mfp.
         (typically < * 10 micro g/cm2)

	 Default value is 0.1.   0.05~ 0.5 may be tried
	 depending on the purpose. Smaller one takes longer
	 computation time. If typcal thickness ~ r.l, 0.1
	 OK.

        typical values:
	     KE         L(el)          L(1)
	     1MeV    50 microg/cm2   0.1g/cm2 
             10keV   3   //          10^-4 //

maxHCSmfprl: D=0.05.  If lHard (in rl) is > maxHCSmpfrl
              (> Lambda(el) in r.l),
              it is forced to  be this value (in r.l).
	      This will happen above ~10 MeV.
	      This must be order of magnitude smaller
              than the typical layer thicness of the
              target material in 
	      which multiple scattering effect is important
	      and if you need precise information at very small
	      lateral distance; e.g, in nuclear emulsion inserted
	      between Pb, and look at showers inside handred micron
	      meters. Otherwise, could be much larger.

print_redpdfc1: D=f.  This is not for making sampling table.
		but if you want to have a look at the
		reduced mu(=(1-cos)/2) distribution of
		Coulomb scattering, this may be set to t.
 		  Reduced distribtuion is 

		(true Coulomb distribution)/(MW distribution),

		where, MW distribution is the Modified
		Wentzel distritution. MW has a simple analytic
		form approximating true Coulomb distribtion).
