1) make -f Compton.mk  will create a.out

  ./a.out > outfile
  contents:
   "prob/r.l"    "Eg_out"  "Ee"   "cosg"  "cose"  "path"'
  
2) make -f ComptonSamp.mk
 
 ./a.out > outfile
  contents:
     "Egp/Eg"   "Ee"  "cosg"   "cose"  "path"  "Eg"'

3) make -f DrawComptonXS.mk
  ./XS.out > outfile
  contents:
      "Eg(MeV),    /rl    /(g/cm2)    /cm     mb "

    If XCOM is used(XCOM=1), binding energy effect is taken into 
    account. So there should appear difference from
    XCOM=0 case where Klein-Nishina formula is used. 
    It starts around  1MeV for W.  0.1MeV for Air.

***  ./testXS.sh  will do the business for 3) with gnuplot

4) make -f drawCompFunc.mk 
    This is for Klein-Nishina formula.
      drawCompFunc.out > outfile
  contents
     v, dsdv, cosg, dsdcos, Eg, Egp, Nc, tprob
  where 
      v:  Eg'/Eg
    dsdv:  xs ds/dv
    cosg: cos of Eg'
    dsdcos:  ds/dcosg
    Eg:   incident Eg
    Egp:  Eg'
    Nc:   normalization value
    tprob:  xs   /r.l

5)  ./testComptonSamp.sh
    do the business of sampling-->histograming 
    and compare with funtion.  (with gnuplot)
