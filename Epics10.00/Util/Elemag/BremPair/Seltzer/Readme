Basically the same as
  ATOMIC DATA AND NUCLEAR DATA TABLES 35,345-418 (1986)
     BREMSSTRAHLUNG ENERGY SPECTRA FROM ELECTRONS WITH KINETIC
     ENERGY 1 keV-10 GeV INCIDENT ON SCREENED NUCLEI AND ORBITAL
     ELECTRONS OF NEUTRAL ATOMS WITH 2 = l-100
     STEPHEN M. SELTZER and MARTIN J. BERGER
									
but data points are more dense than the table in this ref.
(The values are different from those given in NIM by the same authors
 in 1985. especially at higher energies say, at 1GeV.)
 Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B12 (1985) 95-134
 Which is referred in Geant4.  NIM dose not inlude atmic electron
 effect thus gives smaller cross-section). However at few to 50 MeV
 region, they say,  uncertanity is 5~10%.
 
  

Why data points are denser than the table in the paper.  I got
floppy disk from Seltzer directory; probably data given there is
more precise than paper.( in 1991 ?).  At that time, e-mail
is not yet so poular (Just before NeXT-STEP was  available. )
and could not transfer attachemnt easily. Machintosh was used at me.

y****   seeData.f
   
    Seltzer & Berger's data (brems01 ~ bremes10) are decomposed into
    each element ranging from Z=1 to 100.
    The data file name is
        SZ1, SZ2, ... SZ100
    corresponding to  Z=1, Z=2,...Z=100.
 
     The format of each line is
      
        v   cross-section  Ek

    where
         v = Eg/(Ee-me)
         cross-section = (beta/Z)**2 v ds/dv (mb)
         Ek = Electron kinetic energy in GeV

    The upper energy may be specified. (GIVE Emax)

    You can inspect each data file by gnuplot

****   unpack.f

     This is almost the same as seeData.f
     Difference is that the files name created is Z1~Z100
     Each file containes only cross-section values.

     The files  Z1 ~Z100 are used when making sampling tables.


     The upper energy may be specified. (GIVE Emax)

     Emax = 4001.

     To read all of the data, you have to change the
     em=41-->53 in Util/Elemag/epBrSeltzer.f
