Emin control:  all energy is in GeV. To avoid confusion, we keep
               scheme used in epicsfile.
Epicsfile:  EminGamma
            EminElec (total Energy) 
	    RecoilKeMin; 0-->(EminElec-mass)
	    KEmin  ;     0-->max(EminElec-mass, 20MeV)
	    EminH  :     0-->max(KEmin, 20 MeV)
       These are fixed when epicsfile is read and then epcmp1 is called and
       saved as public variables:
            EminGsave
            EminEsave
            RecoilEsave
            KEminsave
            Enminsave
       in module "epModify". ( ElecMass=masele is also save; epModify
       cannot use Zmass.h due to .f90 ) 

       When config data is read, modifier bit is examined for each component,
       if modifier is not specified, then the following action is taken
            AutoEmin =0 --> above is employed for each component
            AutoEmin >=1 --> EminGamma, EminElec and RecoilKeMin are fixed
                       by calling  prog/UserMayChange/epAutoEmin.f
		       If AutoEmin is 1, default minimum values are 
                       fixed by using "minimum" thikness of the component
                       (=mt;in g/cm2).  as 200keV * sqrt(mt). However, if it 
                       exceeds  200, 200 keV is used. If it is lower than 10,
                       10 keV is used. 
                       AutoEmin > 1 may be given if the user makes a needed
                       coding in epAutoEmin.f.
                       These 3 values are put in the min E for the 
                       component.  Other two are not set but determined
                       when a particle enters that component.
                          i.e,  KEmin = KEminsave and  EminH=Enminsave
        if modifier is given and correspondig data exists in ModifyFile
                       All five minimum could be specified.  However,
		       if only first few were given, reaining ones are
                       fixed by as above.
