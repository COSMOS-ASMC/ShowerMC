 Eabsorb   6   14    / See also Photo.  To control energy deposit
	                   treatment  when a particle energy becomes 
                           lower than the given  minimum energy. Each of
               the bit of Eabsorb (LSB is the rightmost bit) specifies 
               Normally 6 or 14  may be used.  
               In many cases, min of 100 keV kinetic energy with 6 and 0
               don't make any sizable difference, but in the case of BGO
               or similar heavy crystals,  6 and 0 give a sizable difference
               with 100keV min.  To get the same result for 6 and 0, 
               EminElec=10 keV is needed.   (Many compton electrons < 100 keV
               will appear and if all of them are neglected 5 % underestimation
               could occure in BGO. )

           bit 1:  When the photoelectric effect occurs, some of the
               photon energy becomes absorbed by the atom (shell energy)
               and  the energy conservation apparently breaks.  If this
               bit is on, such an energy is regarded as the  energy loss 
               in the media and included in Move.dEeff. If 0, the
	       missing energy is converted to a charactristic X-ray.
               Thus, bit 1 is 0 is more accurate than bit 1 is 1.
	       However, if the incident energy is high and your energy
               loss counter is not like BGO (e.g, plastic scinti),
	       you may safely bit 1 on.
           bit 2:  When a photon energy becomes lower than EminGamma, the
               photon tracking is ceased. If the bit is on, the photon
               energy is regarded as absorbed at the point and included
               in the energy deposit.
           bit 3: When an electron or positron energy becomes lower than
               EminElec, the tracking is ceased. If this bit is on, the
               remaining kinetic energy of the electron or the posititron
               energy + electron mass is regarded as absorbed at the point
               and included in the energy deposit.
           bit 4: When the kinetic energy of a proton/heavy ion  becomes 
               < KEmin,  its tracking is ceased. If the bit is on,
               the kinetic energy is regarded as absorbed at the point
               and included in the energy deposit.
           bit 5: When the kinetic energy of a neutron becomes < EminH
               its tracking is ceased. If the bit is on, the kinetic energy
               is regarded as absorbed at the point and included in
               energy deposit.
           bit 6: When the total energy of an anti-proton or anti-neutron
                becomes < KEmin, its tracking is ceased. If the bit is on,
               its( energy +  mass) is regarded as absorbed at the point
               and included in Move.dEeff.
           bit 7: When the total energy of  a particle which may decay
                soon after stopping (pi, K, mu) becomes  < KEmin, its
               tracking is ceased.  If the bit is on, its kinetic energy
               is regarded as absorbed at the point and included in
               energy deposit.
           bit 8: For other particles not falling in the category shown
               above, their tracking is ceased when their kinetic energy
               becomes < KEmin.  If the bit is on, its energy is regarded
               as absorbed at the point and included in the energy deposit.

                             Moliere is better but Gaussian is faster
                             so that  to have a quick look, you may
                            use 0 in some case.  Gassian give normally 
                            smaller spread. AlatCor may be 0 or 1 in any 
                            case.  (result almost no change).  
			    "2" uses completely different scheme than "1" for
                            Moliere scattering: more rigouros,  and small
                            angle restriction is removed.  But the result
                            is completely the same as the case of 1 while
                            cpu time increases 1.6 times !
 Photo    t                   /  Photo electric absorption is  taken
                                 into account or not.  If this is t,
	               and media has high Z (such as Pb),  the K-shell
	               energy becomes  close to the default EminGamma.
                       Then apparent non-energy conservation may be seen
                       in the sum of the deposited energy ( in the form of 
                       ionization loss) in the media,
	               since the energy of emitted electron is
                              Ee = Eg - Eshell + Me.
                       (If Eg ~ Eshell, there appear only a stopping electron
                       and this means the energy of the photon disappears).
	               The amount of energy lost in this process in Pb becomes
                       as large as ~4% for electron incident case. That is,
	               if the incident electron has 100 MeV, the total energy
	               deposited in Pb is ~95 MeV. For Fe, it becomes as
                       small as 0.1 %.  
         Eabsorb detemines how to treat the energy absorbed in the atom.
                       The default 1 (non 0) is to count the absorbed energy as
                       a part of energies deposited in the media. 
                       0 is to neglect such energy in the energy loss count.

                       X-ray is generated.

 RecoilKeMin   0      /  Knock-on electron  of kinetic energy >
                         RecoilKeMin is explicitly produced, if Knckon=t.
                         Default 0 means that it is 
                         replaced by min kinetic electron energy,i.e,
		         (EminElec - electron_mass).
                          ********************* 
                          For very thin material(~30 micron m), 
	                  you may think you have to  set EminElec and 
	                  EminGamma very small; then, this value becomes
	                  also very small; but such setting dose not give
                          good result.  If you give very small Emin, 
                          you must  set this  approx  max of
	                  (10 keV.,  10*Z**2 eV)

          Lines follow describe how to treat muon energy loss.  
          The ionization loss is always considered (but see  Knckon).
          The direct pair creation, bremsstrahlung and  nuclear interaction
          of muons become important at high energies  (normally at few 10
          GeV for high (Z,A) material, and few 100 GeV for low (Z,A)).
          Independently of the parameter values below, if the loss due to
          each of the 3 processes is < 1 % of dE/dx(ionization), the 
	  process is neglected.  Also, if a given media  has no table
          for the muon energy loss, the loss is neglected. Among the 3
          processes, nuclear interaction has least significance, then
          follows bremsstrahlung. The direct pair creation has the largest
	  contribution which mainly comes from a number of low energy
          pair emissions. However, the nuclear interaction and bremsstrahlung
          may sometimes give a large loss and lead to  big fluctuations.
          
          
                 
 MuPr     3       /   0--> direct e+e- pair creation by muon is completely
                              neglected.   
                      1--> energy loss by pari creation  is included
	                   in dE/dx of muons as a continuous energy loss.
                           Let v= E_transfer/Emu,  the loss here is
                           Integra(vc:vmax) of (Emu vdsigma/dv).
                           (vc ~0, vmax~1).  This is not to be used
	                   for thin material and also for energy loss
                           count in the media.
	                   Can be used only to see muon energy after
                           long path. But no range fluctution is
                           included so that it is  useful to  see the diff.
                           from MuPr=2 or 3. 
                       2--> Energy loss by pair is included in dE/dx
                            of muons as a continuous energy loss in
                            which only the energy transfer smaller than 
                            vmin(=10^-4) of the muon energy 
	                    is included.  The  loss here is 
                            Int(vc: vmin) of (Emu vdsigma/dv).
	                    The portion of loss by v>vmin is treated as
                            a stocastic  process. However, the product 
                            from the pair creation itself is neglected.
                            This can be used only if you want to see
                            muon energy but not to see energy dedposit
                            in the media.  Range fluctuation is included.

                         3--> the same as 2, but the pair creation is
                              explicitly  included to produce e+e-.
                              This is most precise but if
                              you want to see only muon energy 
                              MuPr=2 may be employed.
                   See NOTE below:
 MuBr   3          /      The same as MuPr but for bremsstrahlung.
                   See NOTE below:                   

 MuNI   3          /     The same as MuPr but for muon nuclear interaction
	                 For most of thin media or at low energies,
                         nuclear interaction can be  neglected.
                         The n.i is treated as a gamma-nucleus 
                         interaction.  
  **NOTE*** 
            If you are interested in single muon peak (espeically
            by low energy muons <10GeV), MuBr=MuPr=MuNI=0 is ok. 
	    However, if you need average energy deposit by muon
	    MuPr=MuBr=3 is needed.  Most frequent interaction among
            these 3 is pair creation, and then brems.  Even so
            pair creation is rather rare event and fluctuaion is very
	    large so the MuPr=1 and MuPr=3 could give completely 
            different result. However, single muon peak differecne by 0 or 3
            is ~ 1% level.
