This is a trial ModifyFile which is intended to spcify the quenching
coefficients and / or minimum energies specific to some components.
Quenching coeff. are normally given in the media file, and the
minimum energies used in the tracking are given via epicsfile (or
automatically determined).  If these treatments are not suitable
for paticular components, we can use this file.  To specify the
modification, config data for the component must contain a number
in the modifer field like
                   |<---this is modifier field.

                              but we should  avoid to use a large number

Any comment can be placed before the ------ 
line.  The data must be given after that although the lines starting with
# or (a-z) or (A-Z)  are also regarded as comment. 
Each data  line must start with a number which corresponds to the number
in the modifier field of the component.  
At present, two fields must be put with / at each end of the field.
If there is no need to put one of them,  simply put / only.
1)  Quehcning coeff.  
For Talre's formula:
         c1 c2  T /
where c1 is (g/cm2)/GeV unit. c2 is a unitless number.
In this case,
 cf = (1.-c2)/(1.+(1.-c2)*c1*dEdx) + c2  is computed and cf is multiplied
to dE/dx (GeV/(g/cm2)) to get effective dE/dx.

For Log formula
         c1 c2 c3 L /
where c1 in (g/cm2)/GeV, c2 unitless number, c3 in (g/cm2)/GeV.
In this case, cf is computed by
   cf = (c3*dEdx)**( - c2*log(c1*dEdx))
For Birks formula
         c1 0  0  B /
         c1 0 0 /
c2, c3 are not used but mut be given as 0
c1 in (g/cm2)/GeV
cf = 1./(1. + c1 * dEdx)
    
2)  Minumum energies. format is
   Egmin Eemin RecoilEmin  KEmin Enmin /

where Egmin is the photon minimum energy 
      Eemin is the elecron minimum energy(*** total energy***)
      RecoilEmin is the knockon minimum energy above which random
      sampling of knockon electrons is tried 
      KEmin  minumum kinetic enrgy for charge particles (non electron).
      Enmin  minumum kinetic  energy of nutrons.  default is 5 MeV.

      If first 3 are to be modified, only first 3 may be put with /
      For anti-particles and decayable particles, these minimum energies
      are not directly applied.
