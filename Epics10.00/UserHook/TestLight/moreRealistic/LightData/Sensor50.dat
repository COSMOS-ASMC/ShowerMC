  The format is the same as Lightxx
  This gives the properties of light sensor (PD etc)
------------------------------------------------------------
 Qeff 0.80  / 0.8
     Quantum efficiency of the sensor. Used when QeffFile is dummy
 QeffFile  dummy / dummy.
     Quantum efficienty of the sensor as a function of wavelength.
     Pairs of (wavelength,  efficiency) in unit of (nm, %) must be
     given  in each line. If dummy, Qeff is used for all wavelength. 
     Note that efficiency is expressed by percentage.
