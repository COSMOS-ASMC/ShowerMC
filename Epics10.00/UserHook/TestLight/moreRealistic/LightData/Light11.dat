  Format: basically the same as sepicsfile. But we write example
  values after "/",  So the values before "/" are always employed.

  Any comment before ----------------------- line.
  After that, a 'name' starting from the 2nd column must be the one
  defined in the system. It must be followed by  value(s) which in 
  turn followed by "/" (slash).  The values after "/" are typical
  example values.
  The name may appear in any order.
  If a line starts  from the 3rd or a later column, it is regarded
  as a comment line. 
  Light parameter given in sepicsfile means
    Light=0  the values below are not referred. (this file is not
             read)

 refracIndex     / 2.2
      component's  refracion index n.
      Used if refracFile is "dummy".
      If blank, data given in config file will be used. 
      If single data is given, it is used as refractive index 
      For gases one may get wave length dependence in the following form:
      If two terms, a and b, are given, index n is assumed to be
      (n-1)*10^8 = a + b*f^2.  (Note not (n-1)x10^6 as in PDG).
      where f = 1/w.l (w.l = wave length in cm, not nm here). 
      If three terms, a, b, c are given, index n is assumed to be
      (n-1)*10^8 = a + b/(c-f^2).   For these, see

      If it is difficult to use simple formulas, tabulate the values
	and give it in next.
 refracFile  'dummy' / 'dummy' 
      File name which is assumed to be in the dirctory shown in
      "LightDir" (i.e,  the directory given by LightDir in sepicsfile).
      The refraction index is usally a function of the wave
      length. If it is known, this must be given in this file: pairs
      of (wl, index) in each line. Wave length unit is nm.
      index is unitless. If 'dummy', no file is
      assumed and the value given by refracIndex is used.

 refMode   1    0  1  1  0    1    /   1   0   1  1   0      1    
	1--> wrapper is reflector.  0-->grease etc.  -1-->no wrapper
       see below.
 wrapper 0.8 1.445  0.8 0.8  1.445 0.8  / 0.80 1.445 0.8  0.8  1.445 0.8
	wrapper is a thin 'light' medium such as grease,  thin
      light reflector such as Al or white paint... which are not
      included in config.
      used when wrapperReflecFile="dummy" for reflection (refMode=1)          
      or   when wrapperRefracFile="dummy" for refraction (refMode=0)           
           wrapperRefracFile is different from RefracFile                     
      The values specify how the each surface of the compoent is
      surrounded.  Normally, we don't put very thin wrapper or grease
      surrounding the component in the config, but we have to consider
      such wrapper or grease for light propagation. The values in refMode
      and wrapper correspond to surface # 1, 2,...  of the component
      in local coordinate. (see surfaceNo.pdf):
      box:  #1 xy@z=0, #2 yz@x=boxa, #3 xz@y=0, #4 xz@y=boxb
            #5 yz@x=0, #6 xy@z=boxc.
      cylinder: #1 bottom, #2 top, #3 column part.
         If the # of surfaces is n and  less than the # of values 
	 given above, only first n are used. 

     refMode: 1--> wrapper is a reflector (such as Al, Ag, white sheet..)
               with the reflection coeff.,   the value in wrapper.
              0--> wrapper is a grease or very thin transparent material
	           such as clad of a fiber. It's refractive index is given
                   in the corresponding wrapper value.
              -1--> no warpper; the componet is adjacent to another componet
	           (or void) described in config. wrapper is not consulted.
                   If the refraction index of that adjacent component is
		    0, the light is instantly  absorbed.

     wrapper. See above.  Normally, if the value is less than 1,
          it should be a reflector and if it is greater than 1, it should
	  be a transparent thin medium. So we may live without "refMode".
	  But in some case, we may use 1 for both so we introduced refMode.
	  (For low energy X-ray, refraction index may be < 1., though
	  we don't treat such case at present).
	  If the index is given, we compute the reflection or refraction 
	  probability  and continue the ray tracing.
          If the component has multi-layer clads, we should put such 
	  clads in config file directly with wrapper=0.
       If refMode is 1 and r=wrapper > 0, r-fraction of light is reflected
       and (1-r)-fraction of light is absorbed.
       If refMode is 0 and n2=wrapper> 0, reflection or refraction happenes.
       Their ratio is computed automaticaly using n1 and n2 and light angle
       and ray tracing continues.  The refracted light may enter a sencor
       in some case.

       see above. wave length vs wrapper's refraction coef.   
 mirror  1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 /  1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 
      (see FuzzyFac,too)
      The angle of the reflected light is dermined by this.
      The values correspond to the surface # as refMode or wrapper do.
      If mirror is 1, the reflected light has the same angle as
      the incident light with respect to the normal vector of the
      surface at the reflection point. (complete mirror reflection).
        It is  assumed that  (1.-"mirror") is diffusive refl. 
      Normally, if the wrapper is white, it is said that diffusive
      (random) reflection happens so that the reflection angle becomes
      isotropic.  Normally, mirror may be 0 or 1.
 fuzzy  0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.  /  0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.  
      This introduces some fuzzy factor for the reflection/refraction angle.
      If 0, exact Snell's law is assumed. 
      If > 0., it is taken as a Gaussian spread sigma in deg around the
      exact Snell's law; light angle is fuzzified by the Gaussian random
      factor. (Not used for diffusive reflection).

 maxPathFac 100. / 50. etc　
      Let maxPath=maxPathFac*(max dimension of the component) 
      If the light travels longer than this maxPath, ray tracing
      is ceased and the light is assumed to be absorbed.

 Rayleigh    0  /  
      If this is 0 or blank, Rayleigh scattering is not considered
      in Light media. Note this is independent of coherent scattering
      (Rayleigh scattering) of X/gamma rays > 1keV which is always
      considered in Epics.

 Mie         0 /
      If this is 0 or blank, Mie scattering is not considered
      in Light media. 

 attenL 0.   / 150 etc
      Light attenuation length.  If attenFile is not given, this is 
      is used for all light wave length.   (cm)
      (Note: 0 is special;  no attenuation in this case) 

 attenFile  'dummy' / 'dummy'.  
      File name.  The file is assumed to be in "LightDir" (see refRacFile)
      referred when actual ray tracing is performed.
      If the light attenuation length is a function of wave length,
      and is known, give the list of (wl, attenL) in the file
      one pair in one line.  Unit is (nm, cm)
      
 NpPerMeV 200  / 3000 etc
      Absolute scintillation photon number generated by MeV energy deposit.
      Poisson fluctuation will be introduced if the number is small.


 waveLenFile 'dummy' / 'dummy'
       File name.  The file is assumed to be in "LightDir".
       This is referred when ray tracing is needed.
       If the wave length distribution of emitted light is known, give
       it in the file; pair of (wl, dN/d(lamda) must be given  in each
       line.  Unit (cm, arbitrary). If this is dummy,
       no file is assumed and peakWl is used.

 peakWL 550   / 500 
       Effective  Wave Length (nm) of the scinti. of emitted light. 
       If waveLenFile is not given, this is used, but
       even if  waveLenFile is given, this is used for the effective
       wave length (peak wave length) in some case.
        If the max value in the file and this one differ very much, 
       warning may be issued.
       quench    0 0 0      / 0 0 0 obso
       Bircus coef. for quenching effect of the scintillator 
       If 0, or not given, values defined in media file is employed
       
 minmaxWL  200  800 /  200 800
       (nm).  When a Cerekov light is emitted, its  wave length 
       distribution is 1/L^2 dL and short wave length light is
       more probable. However, short wave length light is normally
       instantly absorbed in the media, or the sensor may not have
       quantim efficiency to that light. These factors might be not
       well known so we may cut the light outside of this range
       for Cerenkov light.  For low energy charged particles,
       the upper limit may be automatically lowered.
  
 NpSample  1000  / 3000
       Used when Light=11,12 or 22
       Maximum number of photons actually traced for scinti photons
       generated  in a given unit cell.  If the number of photons
       is larger than  this, we get the final result by increasing 
       the result so far by a factor of RNp/NpSample, 
        where RNp is the total number  of photons.  
 CellSize  1 10 10 / 1 10 10  (let 3 values be p, q, r)
       When Light is 12, 21 or 22, and scintillation is to be treated
       (i.e, B's 3 bits are xx1; see manual), we store energy deposit
       in Edepo(:::) which corresponds to a number of cells in a
       component.  The unit cell size
       (dx,dy,dz) is determined p,q,r(%) of the component size.
       If the component is a box, dx = p*boxa/100, dy=q*boxb/100,
       dz=r*boxc/100
       In normal situation, boxa is longest side so p may be smallest.
       However, if boxc is longest, r must be smallest. 

       If the component is a cylinder, dx=p*R/100, dy=q*R/100, dz=r*H/100.
       In this case, normal situation is that sensor is at xy plane
       (z=0 and/or z=H) so r should be small (~1)  while p,q may be 
       larger (~10).
       For example, (p,q,r)=(1,10,10), and box size (20,2,2)cm
       (dx,dy,dz)=(2, 2, 2) mm.  One may think 10 % is too large, but
       for the direction transverse to the sensor direction, normally
       ~10 % is OK.
