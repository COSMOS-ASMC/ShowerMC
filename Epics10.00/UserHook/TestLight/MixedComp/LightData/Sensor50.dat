  The format is the same as Lightxx
  This gives the properties of light sensor (PD etc)
------------------------------------------------------------
 Qeff 0.80  / 0.8
     Quantum efficiency of the sensor. Used when QeffFile is dummy
 QeffFile  'testqeff.dat'/ 'dummy'.
     Quantum efficienty of the sensor as a function of wavelength.
     Pairs of (wavelength,  efficiency) in unit of (nm, %) must be
     given  in each line. If dummy, Qeff is used for all wavelength. 
     Note that efficiency is expressed by percentage.
 mnOfScinti   10 /
    this sensor is attached to a scintillator of which property
    is specified by 'mn' of countDE part of the scintillltor in config.
    (even indirectly via light guide).  This is used to get
     the scintillator's  peakWL when converting charged particle
     effect to number of p.e. The charged particle direct hit is
     nomally converted to the number of p.e by  dE*cF/Ex where dE
     is the energy deposited in the sensor, Ex the energy
     corresponding to peakWL of the scintillator and cF the correction factor.
