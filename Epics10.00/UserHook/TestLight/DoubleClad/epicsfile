	                   treatment  when a particle energy becomes 
                           lower than the given  minimum energy. Each of
               the bit of Eabsorb (LSB is the rightmost bit) specifies 

           bit 1:  When the photoelectric effect occurs, some of the
               photon energy becomes absorbed by the atom (K shell energy)
               and  the energy conservation apparently breaks.  If this
               bit is on, such an energy is regarded as the  energy loss 
               in the media and included in Move.dEeff. 
           bit 2:  When a photon energy becomes lower than EminGamma, the
               photon tracking is ceased. If the bit is on, the photon
               energy is regarded as absorbed at the point and included
               in Move.dEeff.
           bit 3: When an electron or positron energy becomes lower than
               EminElec, the tracking is ceased. If this bit is on, the
               remaining kinetic energy of the electron or the posititron
               energy + electron mass is regarded as absorbed at the point
               and included in Move.dEeff.
           bit 4: When the kinetic energy of a proton becomes < KEmin,
               its tracking is ceased. If the bit is on, the kinetic energy
               is regarded as absorbed at the point and included in
               Move.dEeff.
           bit 5: When the kinetic energy of a neutron becomes < KEmin,
               its tracking is ceased. If the bit is on, the kinetic energy
               is regarded as absorbed at the point and included in
               Move.dEeff.
           bit 6: When the total energy of an anti-proton or anti-neutron
                becomes < KEmin, its tracking is ceased. If the bit is on,
               its( energy +  mass) is regarded as absorbed at the point
               and included in Move.dEeff.
           bit 7: When the total energy of  a particle which may decay
                soon after stopping (pi, K, mu) becomes  < KEmin, its
               tracking is ceased.  If the bit is on, its kinetic energy
               is regarded as absorbed at the point and included in
               Move.dEeff.
           bit 8: For other particles not falling in the category shown
               above, their tracking is ceased when their kinetic energy
               becomes < KEmin.  If the bit is on, its energy is regarded
               as absorbed at the point and included in Move.dEeff.

 Photo    t             /  Photo electric absorption is  taken
                                 into account or not.  If this is t,
	               and media has high Z (such as Pb),  the K-shell
	               energy becomes  close to the default EminGamma.
                       Then apparent non-energy conservation may be seen
                       in the sum of the deposited energy ( in the form of 
                       ionization loss) in the media,
	               since the energy of emitted electron is
                                   Ee = Eg - Eshell + Me.
                       (If Eg ~ Eshell, there appear only a stopping electron
                       and this means the energy of the photon disappears).
	               The amount of energy lost in this process in Pb becomes
                       as large as ~4% for electron incident case. That is,
	               if the incident electron has 100 MeV, the total energy
	               deposited in Pb is ~95 MeV. For Fe, it becomes as
                       small as 0.1 %.  
         Eabsorb detemines how to treat the energy absorbed in the atom.
                       The default 1 (non 0) is to count the absorbed energy as
                       a part of energies deposited in the media. 
                       0 is to neglect such energy in the energy loss count.

          Lines follow describe how to treat muon energy loss.  
          The ionization loss is always considered (but see  Knckon).
          The direct pair creation, bremsstrahlung and  nuclear interaction
          of muons become important at high energies  (normally at few 10
          GeV for high (Z,A) material, and few 100 GeV for low (Z,A)).
          Independently of the parameter values below, if the loss due to
          each of the 3 processes is < 1 % of dE/dx(ionization), the 
	  process is neglected.  Also, if a given media  has no table
          for the muon energy loss, the loss is neglected. Among the 3
          processes, nuclear interaction has least significance, then
          follows bremsstrahlung. The direct pair creation has the largest
	  contribution which mainly comes from a number of low energy
          pair emissions. However, the nuclear interaction and bremsstrahlung
          may sometimes give a large loss and lead to  big fluctuations.
          
          
                 
 MuNI     0          /   0--> nuclear interaction of muon is completely
                              neglected
                         1--> energy loss by n.i is included in dE/dx
                              of muons as a continuous energy loss.
                              Let v= E_transfer/Emu,  the loss here is
                              Int(vc:vmax) of (Emu vdsigma/dv).
                              (vc ~0, vmax~1).
                              
                  
                         2--> energy loss by n.i is included in dE/dx
                              of muons as a continuous energy loss in
                              which only the energy transfer smaller than 
                              vmin=10^-3 of the muon energy is included.
                              The  loss here is 
                              Int(vc: vmin) of (Emu vdsigma/dv).
	                      The portion of loss by v>vmin is treated as
                              a stocastic  process. However, the product 
                              from the n.i itself is neglected
                         3--> the same as 2, but the n.i is explicitly
                              included to produce a number of particles.
                              The n.i is treated as a gamma-nucleus 
                              interaction.
 MuBr   0          /      The same as MuNI  but for bremsstrahlung.
 MuPr   0          /      The same as MuNI  but for direct pair creation. 
 
 KEmin  0     0   /      Minimum kinetic energy (GeV) of heavy particles
                          (mu, pi, K, n, p, ... ) to be tracked. 
                          (Some may be tracked even if 
                          the energy becomes smaller than this when it can
                          annihilate or decay to produce particles of kinetic
                          energy > KEmin. If 0 is given, EminElec-Me is  
                          taken.  If you are interested in only muons, 
                          hadrons, and ignor the photo-hadron production,
                          you may set EminElec, EminGamma very large while
                          keeping this small. It is be very much effective
                          to do a fast simulation. 

 MsgLevel 1             / if 2, all (warning, error) messages are shown.
                           if 1, some (important, fatal error) messages are
                           shown.
                           if 0 only fatal error is  shown.
 
 MediaDir '../../../Data/Media'   /directory path to the media data.
                                You can put a max of 3 paths by giving
                                additional  two in below. The media
                                name is searched for from the first path.
                              You can use ".." or "."  but not "~" nor
                              $EPICSTOP.
 MediaDir ' '              / another path
 MediaDir ' '              / one more another path
           TraceDir ' '          / if ' ',  /tmp/$USER/trace1 will be the
                             file for trace, else  given dir/trace1 is used.
