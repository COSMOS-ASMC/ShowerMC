Some documentation:  indexing.pdf

Before make:
1) Fix a program for treating index management from
   prog/ex1.f to ex8.f; edit it, if needed. 
 or
   create some file:  ex10.f  etc
Then,
    rm example.f
    ln -s prog/ex?.f example.f
  where ? is selected number.
    make clean     
    make 
Before run, we must fix the "config" depending on exxxx.f

 exxx.f and  config file correspondecne is
   ex1.f   config
   ex2.f   config
   ex3.f   config
   ex4.f   configB
   ex5.f   configB3
   ex6.f   configB3
   ex7.f   config
   ex8.f   config

configB and configB3 are included here.

**But** 
  config is a link to somewhere/config
  so you must have such config file somewhere
  If config uses CnfgDir, it  must be
  also a link to somewhere/CnfgDir
  To fix the link, 
  rm config
  rm CnfgDir
  ln -s somewhere/config config
  ln -s somewhere/CnfgDir CnfgDir

When config is fixed, enter it to FirstInput.

Then, run the program as usual, say, by 
 sepicPCLinuxIFC64 < FirstInput  2> tempout
