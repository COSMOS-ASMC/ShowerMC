This is to test clorez:
  make clean; make
  will make test$ARCH  binary.
to test  ./test$ARCH

At execution
give p= px,py,pz in some system.(in GeV)
   which is assumed to be moving z diretion by
   gb=(0,0,gbeta, beta)
   g is changed from 1 to ~10^12. step 10^0.25.
   (for proton, ~10^21 eV).
    p is converted to po seen from the rest system.
Then, po is converted to q in  original moving system.
   using  gb=(0,0,-gbeta, -beta).
q should be p.   The relative accuracy is computed.
 like  (p-q)/p

 clorez.f90 is made   24,Jun, 2016 and old one was
 moved to clorez.fold
 
put various pz   small to large ( positive and negative
                 values.)
		 

old one:  accuracy is sometimes 13 digits.  In many  cases
          ~16 digits.  poor accuray happens rather moderate
	  g region.

new new: is in clorez.f90.   accuracy is always ~16 digits.
