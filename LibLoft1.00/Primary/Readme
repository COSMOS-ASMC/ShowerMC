This dirctory contains the Primary class.  For a normal use, you may

1) Prepare energy spectrum data in a file.  
   The data format example is in sample.d in the Data/Primary directory. We can
   express a number of spectra of arbitrary shape in a simple form.
2) Give the file name in a file for namelinst Param.

3) call  ciniSPrim
     to initialize the primary energy and species sampling.   The spectrum 
     file name must be given to the subroutine.
4) call csampPrimary
      to sample a one primary.  One particle data is  returned.
For details, see testSampPrim.f in Util 


 Every detailes of primary spectra  are contained in the class,
/primaries/.  So, for example, you can know the number of samlings
by 
 
 call cqNoOfPrim(number)

------list of files which conain subroutines and their synopsis---
ciniSPrim.f
  ciniSPrim  Initiaize primary sampling routines by giving a
                      a file name where spectrum data is given. 
	              csetPrimTbl and csetEUnitTbl are called.
	              Record is made in "Prim" in common section given
	              in Zprimaryv.h
  ciniSPrim0  read a given spectrum data and establish a primary
	              record in a given record area.
  csetPrimTbl       set the symbols table usable for primary components
  csetEUnitTbl     set the energy unit table (keV, GeV etc) usable

cmkPrimSTbl.f
  cmkPrimSTbl  assumign raw primary information is givne in a given 
                     record,  make primary sampling table  for that record
cprintPrim.f
  cprintPrim     print "Prim" primary record information breifly
  cprintPrim0    print a given primary record info. breifly.
  cprintEachCmp   slave of the aboe

  cprocPrimDt    Process a given pimary record to be ready for cmk_..
  cexmPrimSymb    examine primary symobls in a given primary record
  cexmPrimEU   examine primary energy unit in a given priamry record
crdPrimData.f
  crdPrimData       read a primary record from a given file into a given
                        primary rcord area.
  crdCompPrim  slave of the above. segments data is read
csampPrimary.f
  csampPrimary      Samples a primary particle from "Prim" record
                     and returns /ptcl/ data
  csampPrimary0     Samples a primary particle from a given primary record
  csampPrimary1     slave of the above
  cconv_prim_e       convert primary energy in a given primary record into
                     total energy in GeV unit to be used in Cosmos
  cqPrimE   inquire sampled primary energy/momentum in the form
                     specified in  "Prim"
  cqPrimE0       inquire sampled primary energy/mometum in the form
                          specified in a given primary record
  cqPrimLabel    inquire the sequence number of the sampled component
                          for "Prim" record.
  cqPrimLabel0   inquire the sequence number of the sampled component
	                   for a given record
  cqPrimary     inquire primary spectrum record information of "Prim"
  cqNoOfPrim    inquire the number of sampled primaries.
