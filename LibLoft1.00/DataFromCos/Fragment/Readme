N-A-A'.parm:  contains the number of nuclelon information when proj. mass  # is A
              and target mass # is A' for a given # of  the total spectator nucleons

1st col:  average # of free nucleons
2nd col:  rms. of the#
3rd col:  # of events
4th col:  # of total spectator nucleons.

For sampling, we may use Gassian with mean and rms given here.


H-A-A'.parm:  contains the heavy ion information when projectile mass # is A
              and target mass # is A' for a givne # of   the sepetator nucleons 
	      except for nucleons going as free nucleons.
1st col:  average # of  heavy ions (d,He3,He4)
2nd col:  rms. of the #.  
3rd col:  # of events 
4th col:  # of spectators except for those going as nucleons. (actual # is within
          +/- this number.

For sampling of heavy ions, we can use Poisson distribution.
