change from original.
0)  All characters are converted to small letters.
    This is due to nucrin, hadrin etc (already existing ones )
    which are called from Gheisha.
1)  cghe2cos.f  cgheDecay.f and ccos2gheCode are added for
    interface with Cosmos. These have been moved to
    Particle/Event/Interface
2)  gutil.f is modified to call rndc instead of rnndo for 
    uniform random number generation.
3)  In gpghei.f, RANDO declearation is removed; it is not used.
     gpghei returns mfp in g/cm2. This is done by giving rho = 1.
    to GSMATE.
4)  Somefiles (see Obso/DupSymbols) are moved to Obso/ since they are
    defined in Import/aadn.f and aado.f  (Nucrin members)
5)  call hadrin, call nucrin are made to call hadrinC and call nucrinC
    when hall old Lund related external names are changed to xxxC
---------------
To use gheisha, one must do;
1)  call gpart
2)  call gheini

3) To establish, matter, 

	call gsmate for simple a,z
	call gsmixt for complex matt.




4)      call gheish(....)

How to use gsmate

     SUBROUTINE GSMATE(IMAT,A,Z,DENS,RADL,ABSL)
This is to store the given material inside the subrutine with
index imat. This material is taken out by GFMATE with a given
index.

How to use gsmixt

     Entry GSMIXT(IMAT,NLMAT,WMAT,WHAT,DENS)

To give compound material.  Each element should have been
defined by gsmate before hand with index  j= what(i), where 
i is  the i-th element of the compound.  dnes is the density.

imat: the same meaning as in gsmate.
nlmat: |nlmat| is the number of elements.  
   if >0, wmat contains is proportion by weights of each 
          element in the compound
     < 0, wmat contains the number of atoms in the compound molecule.
          should not be used.
       
the same as gsmate, but wmat, what, dens

Gheisha particle code.  see gpart.f
