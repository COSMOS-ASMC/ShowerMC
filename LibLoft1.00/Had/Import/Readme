OBSO:
----------
DPM is the link to one of DPM-{a,b,c}.

a:  dpmjet3.04b  (some update from  v3.04 by adapting v3.05)
    compatible with Jam which is an updated version of
    the original Jam from Nara san but not with the one
    from PHITS. (due to external name collision).

b:  dpmjet3.04b   (some update from  v3.04 by adapting v3.05)
    Same as 'a' but pythia is modulized so that
    it can be used with Jam from pythia, too.

c:  dpmjet is v3.05.  too much specialized to Fluka
    and cannot generate heavy fragment. So we should not use it.
    Pythia is modulized and common to 'b'.  As to Jam
    same as 'b'
