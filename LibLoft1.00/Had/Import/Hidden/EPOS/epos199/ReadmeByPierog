	I attached a modified version of the code (only epos-bas-199.f, 
epos-ems-199.f, epos-xan-199.f and epos.inc are modified) which contains this 
flag to indicate whether a collision is ND (typ=1), DD (typ=2) or SD (typ=3). 
But it doesn't tell you whether it was projectile or target single 
diffraction (it can be easily modified if you like). I change the 
input-kasahara.optns file to have this "typ" at the end of the line 
indicating the event number before the list of particles. I add this to the 
example.f file too in case you would like to use it later.

	But be careful, this is a "theoretical" definition. For instance, a ND or DD 
event can look very similar at particle level. So please don't do the same 
mistake as the CMS collaboration using some corrections to have NSD events 
based on this kind of model information. You should use only hadron level 
trigger for your data otherwise results are biased. This theoretical flag is 
only good to have an idea of what happen in the code and is model dependent.
