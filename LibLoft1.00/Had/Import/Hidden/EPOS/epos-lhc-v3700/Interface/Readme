modification in EPOS	
1)  epos-bas-3700.f
 a)     common  HIPARNT for HIJING collides with the same
     one in JAM (size is different) so it is comment out.
 b)  HINT1 in that common  is used 3 times.--> comment out


In  epos-sem-lhc-v3400.f
3 varialbs are undefined and not used( coefxu1 etc)
so they are commentout


2)  eposlibList can be made by  getLibterm.sh
    This is used to remove .o files from libcosmos.a
