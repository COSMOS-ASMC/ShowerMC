JAM:update note

  jam1.136   Sep. 18 2009
bug fix: when maxium impact parameter is greater than 90, it was automatically
set min. bias collision, which means that the input value of bmax was
changed inside the code. In this version, this option was eliminated.

  jam1.135   Sep. 18 2009
  bug fix: beam particle k0, kbar0, n0, pi0, xi0 did not work.

  jam1.134   Sep. 14 2009
  bug fix: when one use targ='207:112', one got error.

  jam1.133   Aug. 11 2009
  bug fix: when one wanted to do pA collision, input did not work correctly.

  jam1.132   Mar. 14 2008
  change gfort.f for gcc4.3

  jam1.13   Oct. 14 2007
  add gfortran.f for gcc4.
change jam.f because it did not work with gcc4

  jam1.11   Jan. 21 2007
bug fix for kaon weak decay after simulation.

  jam1.10   Jan. 19 2007
   bug fix
o mstc(42) works.
o additive quark cross section for meson-meson.

  jam1.09   Jul. 19 2005
  o bug fix by A. Ohnishi (taken from jam version jam1.02h-HK.).
Anisotropic resonance decay routine (jamrdec in jamdec.f) is modified
to avoid artificial generation of v2.
o bug fix in jamana.f at subroutine jamfile.


jam1.08   Apr. 9 2005
bug fix for mstc(61)=0: option for isotrophic resonance decay
was not isotropic for delta baryons.

jam1.07   Apr. 4 2005
bug fix pointed out by A. Ohnishi(Hokudai)
fnkick() fnkick2()

jam1.06   Oct. 21 2004
bug fix: mstc(42)=0 option (weak decay after simulation) works now.

jam1.015   Oct. 11 2004
all pythia subroutine, function and commonblock names are changed.

jam1.014   Oct. 10 2004
o fname(8) is now used to specify the directory of the output files.
o some common blcok names and functions which conflict with
the pythia program have been changed. I will change all subroutine
names later.

jam1.012   Sep. 16 2003
 bug fix pointed out by T.Tabaru(RIKEN)
 for the generation of soft pt kick.  pt kick was generated
 randomly from the prepared tables, but it was not smooth enough.

jam1.011.00   Jul. 17 2003
  bug fix in subroutine jamwidm in jamdec.f
  after version 1.009.28  pointed by Ryotaro Muto (Kyoto)
  decays were forbiden when resonance pole mass is less than the sum
  of daughter particles in the case of momentum dependent decay width.
  For example, a0/f0 -> KK channels.

jam1.010.01   Feb. 23 2002
bug fix in jamsoft.f, jamhard.f,jamhij.f  pointed out by Tsuguchika TABARU
  <The result has not been changed in this bug.>
 The information which contains in indd() was wrong. So one gets
wrong information in each string decay in the case that one of decay
products is anit-baryon.  In the case of hard scattering, this
bug is still not removed. If one wants to know the information
for each collision and decay, please ignore partons in the
information. 
jamhij.f
    call jamerrm(30,'(hifun:) This number already used'//code)
--> call jamerrm(30,0,'(hifun:) This number already used'//code)

jam1.010.00   Jan. 04 2002
bug fix in jamdec.f pointed out by Tsuguchika TABARU
      totwid1   = totwid / paru(3)
-->
      totwid   = totwid / paru(3)
(older version < jam1.009.24 is ok)

jam1.009.29   Jan. 10 2001
 bug fix  in jamhij.f at entry vegas2(fxn,avgi,sd,chi2a)

7     continue
        xi(nd,j)=one
 --->
        xi(nd,j)=one
7     continue
 

jam1.009.28   Aug. 31 2000
 1. add dummy subroutine jamanaus to be able to analyze something
    at each collision and decay by users.

jam1.009.27   Apr. 21 2000
 1. update particle data: short lived particles do not decay as a default.
 2. slight modification of code to handle option 'user'.
    To know how to use the option frame="user", main program of main_blz.f
    and mainu.f would be useful.
 3. update jam.tex to explain how to use frame='user'.

jam1.009.26   Apr. 2000
 1.  Add new option 'user' for input variable frame.  This allows for user
     specified phase space data for the initial condition of cascading.
     If frame='user', you have to fill the following common bock.
      common/jamevnt1/r(5,mxv),p(5,mxv),v(5,mxv),k(11,mxv)
      common/jamevnt2/nv,nbary,nmeson
      common/jamjet1/vq(10,mxv),kq(2,mxv)

 2.  add function  'jamflav' that gives baron number or flavour content
      of particles.
 3.  bug fix: no effect on random number seed when input file is used
