1) $LIBLOFT/Had/Import/Jam is linked to jamxxx/src/
2) gfortran.f is modifed:
   time calculation part dose nothing.
   random number part is changed to call rndc
3) The file names are changed to avoid 
   confilict  with NewFritiof:  
   pyjet.f   -> jampyjet.f
   pysigh.f  -> jampysigh.f
   pythia.f  -> jampythia.f
4) vnibook.f is not used so it was moved to
   Test/
5) Makefile is constructed following the one 
   in Gheisha.  jamdat.f is not included in
   Makefile. 
6) jam1.inc and jam2.inc are put in Cosmos/cosmos
   (the same one must remain here)
7) jamdat.f is copied to Cosmos/cosmos/
   and "include" statment in it (2 parts),
   are modified as:
   #include "jam1.inc"
   #include "jam2.inc"
   This is for enabling  block data statement.
