goto some upper directory (xxxx say,LibLoft/) where such part may located in some of sub
directroy of xxxx, and issue
   find ./ -type l -ls | grep cNucMass.f90
or if the scrit is given as
   findLinking.sh cNucMass.f90

Don't go to the top of your home.  It will need very long time to check.

To us find  at here,
   find ../../  -type l -ls | grep cNucMass.f90
is OK.
