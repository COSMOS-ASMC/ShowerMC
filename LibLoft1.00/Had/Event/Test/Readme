Almost Obso.  You can do it by going to Util/Gencol/

histg/histpi0_0.5 etc have factor two higher value due to that
I took forward and backward particles together.
The density must be devided by 2.

testcol.f:
 '# "X" "Xcms" "Pz" "Pzcms" "y" "eta" "pt" "code" '//
     * ' "subcd" "chg" "mult" "teta" "tetacms" "K.E" "K.Ecms" "ev#"'
  This is to test interaction code for hadron - Air or nucleus - Air
  collisions.

  As 'Air' target, you can choose N, O, Ar.  

To compile and run the programn
  make -f testcol.mk
and prepare parm, 
  testcol$(ARCH) < param > outfile

You have to specify everything in param.


----------
to setup pp collision for dpmjet.
use next param.     source Scrpt/sevi in Epics is also needed.

 $PARAM
 ....
 IntModel = '"dpmjet3"',

 $END

 $HPARAM

 UserHookc = 'f 6 -1 1  1.e8  1 1  f  t',       last 1 1 are for p.
             'dpmjet',                          dpmjet
             '  '
