1) make clean
make -f cgetXsTest.mk

a.out > output

will create  E vs cross-section table for
various projectile and  target combinaitons

If pj is non nucleus or 
   pj is nucleus and target is p/n,
 inelastic, total and elastic  cross-sections 
are obtained.  E is the total energy in GeV.

Otherwise, i.e, pj and tg are  both nuclues
only inelastic cross-sections are obtained.

2)
make clean
make -f  cgetXsRatio.mk

./a.out > output

will produce data of
 pj   E(GeV)  Tartget A s(xp)(mb)  s(xA) s(xA)/s(xp)

where a pj is the code of projectile (6 p, 5 Kaon 4  pion)

you may modify some of module part of cgetXsRatio.f

Also you may fix the following to in   cgetXsInterface2.f

SxAbySxpOpt = 0  ! same as 2:  QGS2 like
           !  1.  use table derived from  QGSJET-II-04  (default)
           !  2.  use table derived from dpjmet3
           !  3.  use table dervied from EPOS  
TotXSopt =  2    ! For stotal(pp)  use  1: PDG  3: Totem data
                 !  2 is midlle of 1 and 3.
