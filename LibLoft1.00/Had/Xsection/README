ctotx.f
Basic St for proj.  x  and target p is obtained. 
For A target, 
  St(xp) is converted to A target.
  (St(pp) may be average of pp and np) 

St(pp) is obtained by PGD formula when  Pp>2TeV,  by table Pp>0.4GeV and by
Sel(pp) below that. (i.e Sinel=0 there).

Sel(pp) is by table below Pp=2TeV. Above that, 
   Sel(pp)=St(pp,p) * Sel(pp,p=2TeV)/St(pp,p=2TeV)

Sinel(pp) is by St(pp) - Sel(pp)


Sinel(pA);
  Sinel(pp)  is converted to A target.   Sinel(pp) may be (Sinel(np) + Sinel(pp))/2




The basic xsection routines are in

         cppXsec0.f

which includes:

  p-p, pb_p, pi- p, pi+ p, k- p, k+ p

at  energies below 100 GeV by tables or formulas. 
AT higher energies, Particle data group formulas are used.
But they must not be used at e > 2x10**6 GeV for Pbar P and
e > 500 GeV for others.

These can be used for other incident particle or neutron target case.

         cppXsec.f

is for the entire energy region for the same collisions. At energies
> 1000 GeV (for pp,pbarp), or > 500 GeV (for others),
  if IncreaseXsec == 1 (default),
the power dependence of the lab energy is assumed. 
The power index is Deltpp, Deltpip, Delkp; defaults are
given by the block data 'blkxsectionp' in this file.

         cprotonAXsec.f

includes routines for a neucleus target case.  The value is
calculated from proton target case with a conversion process to
neuclus target case, which was made by some Glaubar theoretic
calculation.

         cxp2xAXsec.f

is for converting x-p xsection into x-A xsection.

         xp2xA.eps 

is to show calculated results for various vaulues of the proton target
xsection into neuclus target.
