sample.d is to explain how to give the primary spectrum data.
delta.d  is an example of delta-function like primary spectrum data.
          This  should not be changed ; used at intallation check  time.
---------------------------------------
Note that in the Util diectory of the top cosmos directory, 
the following utility routines are available to check the primary 
spectrum data.

sss:     check basic raw data (such as sample.d) by showing the
	 spectrum shape (show spectrum shape).
testPrim:  check basic raw data by writing summary table.
	   (the same as written by sampPrim) 
sampPrim:  do sampling of primaries using given spectrum data
           also print the same summary data as testPrim does.
