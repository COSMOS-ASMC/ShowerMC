1)cixsec or cixsec2
  This is needed in each test prog.
2) cmkDCSconst
     allocate  DCSnega
     call cDCSconstForMedia(DCSnega)
     same for TPXSposi
           3)cDCSconstForMedia
	      call cPreReadDCS
                4) cPreReadDCS
                   call cReadTPXS
                     this is to get KEele
		     S0,S1,S2 are also read (only for e-)
                   call cReadDCS  for each elemnt
                   add dcs and make dcs for the media
              call  cPrepIntpDCS
                  make  logdcs
                        logmuval
	     
                  make logKEele
