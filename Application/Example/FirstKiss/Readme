0) If you want to put your userhook (FirstKiss in this case)
   in some arbitrary place you may do so by moving FirstKiss there.
   For other userhook routines,  some may not be compiled
   if they are moved to other places.  In that case,
   change the first few lines as in the chook.f in FirstKiss/.
   (i.e,
  Old hook routine would look like
   #include "../cmain.f"
   #include "chookHybAS.f"
   #include "../ctemplCeren.f"
  These must be changed to
   #include "cmain.f"
   #include "chookHybAS.f"
   #include "ctemplCeren.f"
   )


1) To make the executable, cosmos${ARCH}
  make clean
  make [ -f chook.mk ]

2) If this is successful, then you can run it by

  cosmos{$ARCH} < param

This will show some output on the screen and put particle
track info (trace) here. (trace1 and trace2).

3) You can display the trace by
    disptracebygeomv  trace1
  etc
  The command above needs geomview be installed (and the command
  search path  must include $COSMOSTOP/Scrpt)
  If you don't have geomview,  it's better to install it. Howver
  you can display the trace by gnuplot.  For this you must goto
   $COSMOSTOP/Util; "slide" there will work for display.


  The format of the output is:

  x y z code KE charge  time
  x y z code KE charge  time
  x y z code KE charge  time

  x y z code KE charge  time
  x y z code KE charge  time
  x y z code KE charge  time
  x y z code KE charge  time
  x y z code KE charge  time
...

Two blank lines are to separate the segment of lines. 
Consecutive data lines make one continuos track, though
it may have zigzag shape.  code is the paticle code.
1-gamma 2-electron 3-mu  4-pi  5-kaon 6-nucleon
7-neue  8-neumu
For further code definition, see $COSMOSTOP/cosmos/Zcode.h

=============================
In normal ran, you should put Trace=0
To give random number seeds randomly, you must
give a negative value to the 2nd of InitRN like:

 InitRN = 1324008381  -1973133071
