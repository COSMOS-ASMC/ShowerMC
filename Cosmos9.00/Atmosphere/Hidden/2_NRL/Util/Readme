The programs here are for manipulating  NRL atmophere:
  Generate data for  quick computing of atmophere profile of 
  specifiied condisions( preiod, place )

0)  If the current atmophere model is not NRL,  ypu must once issue
 a command "atmosModel.sh" and select the NRL model to remake the
 library.  
 when you use the NRL model in your applicatoin, you need to set
    AtmosModel = 2
 in the input namelist (&Hparam).

Execution:
  For execution, you must make a input file like template.d
  (the last two lines must be gvien as you like). Then
  
NRLGenData$(ARCH) < yourInputfile > yourOutputFile

This will create two files: one is
NRLAtmos.d
which may be used as input file for Cosmos execution when
 ATMOSPHERE in Zcondc.h is 3.
 To do so, give the file name in AtmosFile in Namelist data.
Longitude and latitude values are taken from the data so
the they must be consistent with those in Namelist.

To avoid confusion, usually better to keep AtmosFile blank
and give NRL_peridon data (4 integer data) like
  day1 day2  hour1 hour2
which specify the period from hour1 to hour2 during
day1 to day2.
   dayi  in 1 to 365  (i=1,2)  (neglect leap year)
   houri in 0 to 24 
If day1 > day2, new year step-over is made.
Also, if hour1 > hour2, midnight step-over is made.

Atmosphere data is prepared as the average during this period.
The longitude and latitude are taken from those in Namelist.
