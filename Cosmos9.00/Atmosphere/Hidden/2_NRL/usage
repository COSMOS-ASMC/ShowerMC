NRL model (NRLMSISE00): Time period and Location dependent atmosphere
model developed by NRL (Naval Research Laboratory, USA)

  If the current atmoshere model is "2: NRL", the user can control
the model either by giving a data to "AtmosFile" or to "NRL_period"
in the namelist &HParm.

A)  If “AtmosFie"e is blank,
    "NRL_period" is referred to specify a period over which the 
average feature of the atmosphere is calculated.
It must be given in the “param” file, otherwise, eor rr stop will be
made. As the location, "LatitOfSite" and "LongitOfSite" in the namelist
data are employed.

   The format of "NRL_period" is:
     NRL_period=day1, day2, hour1, hour2
where day1 and day2 are integers (1∼365). 1 means Jan. 1 and 365
Dec.31 (no leap year consideration). The period from day1 to day2 is
the target period. If day1 > day2, it is assumed that the peirod
straddles Dec.31 to Jan.1. The next hour1 and hour2 are also integers
ranging 0 to 23 and spcify the hours in each day in the period.
If hour1 > hour2, midnight (0) is included. For example, 
     NRL_period = 335 60 21 3
means roughly night time in Dec. to Feb.

  The average is computed by sampling days and hours in the period: 
For days, 7-day step sampling is made, but the day1 and day2 are
always included. (So the last step may not be 7 but greater than 3).
For hours, 4-hour step sampling is made but hour1 and hour2 are always
included (the last step may not be 4 but greater than 2).   For
NRL_period=1 36 0 23, we need a computation time of 4∼5 s.

B) If “AtmosFile” is notlank:
   "NRL_period" is neglected.  In this case, the file content must 
be for the NRL model. The time period and location should be specified
in the file.  If the location is not consistent with the 
 "LatitOfSite" and "LongitOfSite" in the namelist, &Param, stop will
be made.

One example is seen in
   $COSMOSTOP/Data/Atmos/NRLAtmos.d
