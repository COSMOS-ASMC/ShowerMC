This directory contains stuffs for manipulating 
the time dependent atmosphere model by NRL.

The subprougram  used by Cosmos is nrlmsise00_sub.f in 
this directory.  It is included by Cosmos/Atmosphere/cNRLAtmos.f
so it must not be moved or renamed.


To generate or see how  NRL-atmospheric data looks, 
goto Util and see Readme there.

Test directory constains original programs but not used
by Cosmos. 
  nrlmsise00_driver.for
      is  a test program.
  nrlmsise00_output.txt 
      is the output by the test program.

---------------
common /FIT/FAT
in nrlmsise00_sub.f  is not used at all but
collides with the same name  in epos code.
So, it was comment out.
