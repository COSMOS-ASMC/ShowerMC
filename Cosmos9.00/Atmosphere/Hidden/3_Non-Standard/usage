Although, "Non-Standard"  the ingredients are essentially the same
as the "Standard" one. The difference is only in the table defining
the atmosphere so that the user can use "Standard" with "AtmosFile"
specifying such a non-standard file.  The difference will appear
(at present) only in the difference of media composing the atmosphere
(and possibly density profile).

 Inspite of that, for such an atmosphere, probably it would be better
to use "Non-Standard".  One example of such an atmosphere is contained
in $COSMOSTOP/Atmosphere/AtmosModel/withIceH2O.d (If the current
atmosphere model is already "3: Non-Standard"; if not, it is seen in
$COSMOSTOP/Atmosphere/Hidden/"3: Non-Standard"/withIceH2O.d )


A)  If the current atmosphere model is "3: Non-Standard" and
   AtmosFile is blank,
     $COSMOSTOP/Atmosphere/AtmosModel/withIceH2O.d
   is used.

B)  If "AtmosFile" specifies a file, it will be used.

The example data in "withIceH2O.d" looks like:

# height(m)     Temp(K) Press(hP) density(kg/m3)    media
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
  -400    290.75  1062.2          1.2790       ice

   ....


Except for the "media" column, the table values are the
same as the standard atmosphere.  When non blank data appears
in the media column, it is assumed to specify a medium.

The data is given from lower heights (m; 0 is the sea level).
In this example, the first line has "ice" as a medium.
Since ice is defined as non-gas, the data for "temperature, 
pressure, density"  is ignored and the density defined in the
"ice" media file is employed.  The density is assumed to be
constant in the case of "non-gas".   The next line has
no specification for the media. In that case, the same medium
as the lower one is assumed. (If the first line has no medium
specification, "Air" is assumed).
 So in this example, "ice" continues up to 3000 m where
the medium changes to "Air" for which we use data in
"temperature  pressure density" fields. (Actually, we don't use
pressure values anywhere).  
"Air" fills up to 5000 m. From 5000 to 5100 m, H2O is assumed.
H2O*0.01 means that its density is 1/100 of the value given in the
H2O media file (don't discuss here realistic or not).
(For gas medium, Air*0.1 type notation should not be used).
Above 5100 m, "Air" is assumed.  The highest medium must be "gas".
