The above data is:
1st line:  tracefile  profile split outtype 
2nd line:  chgsel   codesel
3-5th line:  detector to primary system conversion matrix

tracefile:   path to the tracefile 
profile:     file to  specify how to slice in detail
split : If t,   data at t1, t1+dt,.. are put into  different files.
        If f,   all data are put into the same file. Different time data
	are  separated by a balnk line.
outtype: 1-->x y z code chg data is output.  file name will be *.dat
         2-->skel data for Geomview is output. (split =f is prob. nonsense)
	    file nemae will be *.skel
	 3--> both of .dat and. .skel are output
---
chgsel  :   -1--> select all charge.  0-->select only neutral 1--> select only 
		charged particls.
codesel :   a max of 9 integers indicating particle code to be displayed.
	 E.g  if 1 3/  gamma rays and muons are selected.  / is needed.
	if  0/,  all particles are selected.
---
matrix:  Primary axis unit vector in Detctor system.
         Used to convert (x,y) in det. system into primary system.
	 To get this matrix, use Util/det2prim.f or det2prim2.f
	 If you don't put a selection conditon by lateral spread (see 
	 timeprofile), or primary is vertical,
	 1 0 0
	 0 1 0
	 0 0 1
 	can be used.

output  data format.

.skel files are understood by Geomview; see Geomview manual.

.dat  files.  If split =t, one file contains data at a time:
	x y z code chg
        x y z code chg
       .....

If split=f,  a consecutive block of data separated by one 
	blank line  indicates particles
	at a time.
	x y z code   chg
	x y z code   chg
        ...
       blank line
	x y z code   chg
	x y z code   chg
        ...
       blank line
...
