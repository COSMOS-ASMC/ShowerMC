From the left field on each line,
t1:  starting time (m length/beta)   
t2:  ending time   (m)
	time slicing is tried in this time interval.
dt:  At t1, t1+d, t1+2dt ...  (<=t2), slicing is performed. (m)N
pixel:  this  size (m) is supposed to be displayed as 1 pixel
	on the screen
rmax:  If particles are far (r> rmax), we dicard.
	if this is 0, all particles are employed.


The first line in this example shows the time slicing 
from 0 to 13770 m with 20 m step. After finishing this
slicing, 2nd line is processed and so on.
The last all zero line indicate the end of input.


offset  E.g, file name will be  ts00001.skel etc if offset=0
                                ts01001.skel etc if offset=1000

maxppt    :  max particles storable at each  time.  maxp in Zprivate2.f is the
	     limit at each time plane, but if you want make it less,
	      you may give this.  Default is maxp (0 is converted to maxp).
maxthin  :  thinning is tried upto this times.  1 is normally good.
	    If particles at a given time are too much, those > maxppt
            cannot be contained  in memory.  Particles in one and the same
	    pixel may be shown only 1 point at display, so we many eliminate
	    them leaving only 1 particle.  This is thinning.  
	    After thinning, we may obtain free space for further recording of
	    particls; but the array may be filled again.  maxthin gives the
   	    limit of such thinning.
outdir: output file is stored in this directory.

output  data format.

.skel files are understood by Geomview; see Geomview manual.

.dat  files.  If split =t, one file contains data at a time:
	x y z code chg
        x y z code chg
       .....

If split=f,  a consecutive block of data separated by one 
	blank line  indicates particles
	at a time.
	x y z code   chg
	x y z code   chg
        ...
       blank line
	x y z code   chg
	x y z code   chg
        ...
