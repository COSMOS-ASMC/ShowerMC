Minuit expanded source files for Unix and Windows 32-bit systems.
Directories:
code: expanded Fortran files and intrac.c for Unix and intracw.c
test: A Fortran test program and the output "test.out" obtained from an Intel
	Redhat 7.2 Linux system with g77/gcc 2.96.


Example build with Fortran compiler f77 and C compiler cc. If required, an
archive library can be made with the ar command.

cd code
f77 -c code/*.f
cc -c unix/intrac.c
ar cr libmyminuit.a code/*.o unix/intrac.o

Test:
cd ../test
f77 *.f ../libmyminuit.a
a.out

Windows, either by copying all the source files to Visual Studio or from the
Fortran command prompt as follows.

df -c code\*.f
cl -c win32\intrac.c
lib -out:myminuit.lib code\*.obj win32\intrac.obj

Test:
cd ..\test
df *.f ..\myminuit.lib
