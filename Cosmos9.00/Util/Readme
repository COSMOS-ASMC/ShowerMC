1) Fix the "vdir" in 'trace' in this directory.
  (say to  /tmp)
2) If a trace data (say, /tmp/foo/trace1) by Cosmos is available, 
   use
   ./trace  6  /tmp/foo/trace1

  This will create ptcl2, ptcl3,.. ptcl6 (some may be missing
  if there is no such particle trakcs) in $vdir.  If 2 is given
  instead of 6, only ptcl2 will be created.
  (2 is for electrons, 3 muon,...).

3) In Geomview, you may specify, ptcl2 etc to display them.


4) The 'colormap' in this directory determines the default color of 
  each particle code. Color can be changed within Geomview.

5) Geomview is available free; For many unix (pc linux, digital unix,
solaris, next) binary is available. The source code is also available.
