make Trace non zero if you want to check the interaction visually.
	(Use disptarcebygeomv in  Cosmos/Util/Geomview)
     If it is 1, incident two particles are also shown with
     2 times longer lines than generated particles.
     If != 1, no incidents are shown.
TraceDir is the directory where trace informatin is put.
UserHookc:  first line is to specify the projectile.  
     	       code subcode charge px, py, pz  (GeV/n);  ptcl moves  +z direction 
            second line is for the target.
	       the same as projectile .  -z is the particle direction
            third line. usually may be absent. If exists, the three real values
            show the collision point (x,y,z) in cm. If absent, no output for 
            xyz. (You can also give the position at Epics run thru sepicsfile).
     ***If you want to change the projectile and target info event by event,
	you may prepare an ascii file which containes  sets of such two (or 3) lines,
	(without ') and give following two lines here.
       UserHookc ='file 52  xyz', 'collision.dat'
       where "file" must be given as it is, 52 is the number used to open/read
       the file (logical number; so you may give a different number),
       "xyz" must present only if you give the collision point info.
       The second argument "collision.dat" is a file name in which you prepare
       the projectile and target info. (so the name may be different).
       Then event generation will continue until EOF is reached or DestEventNo
	is reached.	
UserHookr: first two are  min and max range of direction cosine of generated 
	partilces  in z-direction.
       If want to select only those going +z direction, use 0., 1.0
       3rd one is the length of the track to visualize the collision. 
UserHooki: if the  first one is 0, no output for the event with zero particle generation,
           else, one blank line is put.
           if the secnod one is 0, default output by outresul else
           if 1, by outresulB. The user may change it freely.
