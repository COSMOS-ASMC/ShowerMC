 DestEventNo: two integers. number of events to be generated. 2nd one is used.
 InitRN:  two integers for random number seed. If 2nd one is negative, 
          timer, hostname, process number will be used.
 IntModel:  Interaction model
 Trace :    if non zero, trace data will be put in TraceDir. The file name will be
          trace1, trace2...  These can be visualized as tracks by  disptracebygeomv 
          in  Util/Geomview/. For usage, just do ./disptracebygeomv  there.
 TraceDir: where to put trace files.
 SeedFile: don't touch.
UserHookc: 
       First line is to specify the projectile.  
          code subcode charge px, py, pz  (GeV/c);  ptcl moves standard projectile
          direction is +z direction. (code=9 for  heavy, subcode is A)
          momentum is the total momentum (not /nucleon) (pz>0). 
       Second line is for the target.
          the same as projectile .  -z is the standard particle direction
          (so normally  give negative pz for that). 
          They could,  however, be different.
       ***For large A suc as Pb-Pb at LHC energies by dpmjet:
        change all NMXHKK=90000 to NMXHKK=200000 
	in Import/DPM/dpmjet3.f  and Particle/Event/Interface/cdpmjet.f
        and  make  in each directory. Don't forget to restore the values later.

       Third line. usually may be absent. If exists, the three real values
            show the collision point (x,y,z) in cm. If absent, no output for 
            xyz. (You may give the position at Epics run thru sepicsfile).
     ***If you want to change the projectile and target info event by event,
	you may prepare an ascii file which containes  sets of such two (or 3) lines,
	(without ') and give following two lines here.
       UserHookc ='file 52  xyz', 'collision.dat'
       where "file" must be given as it is, 52 is the number used to open/read
       the file (logical number; so you may give a different number),
       "xyz" must present only if you give the collision point info.
       The second argument "collision.dat" is a file name in which you prepared
       the projectile and target info. (so the name may be different).
       Then event generation will continue until EOF is reached or DestEventNo
       is reached.	
UserHookr: Output is made for particles within certain range of angles relative to
        the z-axis  The min and max of such angles are specified by direction cosines
        relative to the z-axis. 
       First two show such cosine values (min and max).
       If want to select only those going +z direction, use 0., 1.0
       3rd one is the length of the track to visualize the collision. 
UserHooki:  First one: If non-zero, Energy to be given in the dpmjet.inp will be
        shown as /nucleon energy (GeV). and the program run stops there.
        If zero, program will generate events.

       Second one: Output will contain one blank line at the end of each event.
	 If second one is non-zero, there will be no blank line, if there is  
         no particle to be written.
