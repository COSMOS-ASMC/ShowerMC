To make a movie of enlarging trace data, first show a maximum
enlarged figure; then shrink the figure by reapating the
comman (zoom c0 0.5)  or ...
You may select a shirinked image at some point.  Then, you may
count the number of shrinkage (say, 5). Then the that figure may
be enlarged by a factor of 32 to get the last max size figufre.
If you want to make a 280 steps by enlargeing ths smallest figure
(each time enlargiment factor x).
x = 10*(log10(32)/280)  = 1.01245

To repeat 280 times the enlargement and store the figures (ppm files)
by a command, you may modify the awkForZoom
and get the awk command.  Execute it to store the result as doZoom

Enter the command at Geomview window:
(load "doZoom")

The, 280 ppm files (ts00000.ppm to ts000279.ppm) will be created in
this directory. 
You may convert these ppm files to, say, tga files for making a movie.

   ppmtotga.csh  ./

The you will get ts00000.tga... ts000279.tga)
To make a movie from this,

  convert -delay 2.5  ts*.tga  mymovie.mpg

(name of moview file; as you like).
-delay 2.5 specifies the frames / s of the moview; 100/2.5=40 frames/s
