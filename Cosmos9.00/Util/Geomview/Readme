0-a) An environmental variable GEOMVIEW must be fixed to show the
   pass to the directory where the Geomview binary exists.

   For example, 
     setenv GEOMVIEW /usr/bin                            (prob. linux)
   or
     setenv GEOMVIEW /usr/local/Apps/Geomview.app        (prob. nextstep)           
   etc.


0-b) Fix the "vdir" in 'disptracebygeomv' in this directory.

     (say to  /tmp; default)

----------------------------

1) To show  one spcific trace information (suppose it is /tmp/foo/trace1)
 
  Use
   ./disptracebygeomv  6  /tmp/foo/trace1
or
   ./disptracebygeomv  6  /tmp/foo/trace1 earth

  (Second one will display the trace with the earth sphere; The north
   pole is indicated by white colo and the longitude 0 by blue line and
   the equator by red line).

  This will create ptcl21.vect, ptcl31.vect,.. ptcl61.vect (some may be missing
  if there is no such particle traktcs) in $vdir.  If 2 is given
  instead of 6, only ptcl2.vect will be created.
  (2 is for electrons, 3 muon,...  The max number you can give is 9 which is
   for heavy particles (He, Li, ...). 

  *** If one consecutive track has a large number of nodal points
    (> 32000), it is decomposed into more than two files:
	say, ptcl21.vect ptcl22.vect....  This may happen if
        you want to display charged particle tracks propagating
        at large distances from the earth.

2) If you have many number of trace data, it may be better to use

	./slide  2 5 /tmp/foo/ 
or
	./slideWithEarth  2 5 /tmp/foo/ 

by which you can show  /tmp/foo/trace2 to /tmp/foo/trace5.
The second one is for showing the earth sphere together.
 
****Caution:
   Before invoking Geomview, the current Geomview is killed in
  'disptracebygeomv'. However, this will not be successfull sometimes.

------------
 The 'colormap' in this directory determines the default color of 
  each particle code. Color can be changed within Geomview.

------------
 If you show traces of particles in the atmosphere, electron tracks
 normally have the heaviest load and it may be difficult to manipulate
 the display smoothly. In such a case, you may delete the electron tracks
 once, and adjust the display, then again resume the electron tracks.
