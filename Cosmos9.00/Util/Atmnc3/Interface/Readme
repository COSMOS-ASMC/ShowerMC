By using Atmnc3, we can generate low energy 
cosmic rays entering into the atmosphere even
below the geomagnetic cut-off; they are particles
which go up from the earth atmosphere(so called
albedo particles) and come back to the earth again.

Such partilces are geomagneic dependent (i.e, dependent
on the latitue and longitude of the earth) and the 
spectrum shape is difficult to be expressed by a
simple formula. 

Cosmos can generate such particles but it needs
much longer time than Atmnc3 since Atmnc3 uses
tabulated energy spectrum data of particles 
generated  at nuclear collsions
(It's  inclusive sepctrum). 

So we may generate such partilces by Atmnc3 and
1)  make them as incident particles (for detector
    simulation at space or cosmic rays entering
    into the atmosphere)
and/or 
2)  make incident partilce spectum in a certain
    latitude and longitude region and use it
    for 1ry spectum to Cosmos 
etc.

The program, translate, here may be used to convert
Atmnc3 output for such purpose.

The output here means data at a some hight (say 100 km) 
from Atmnc3 as stdout and looks like

310   403138 -3471379  -973521  5739772 -9999999  655845731  445081501 -609728492

...

How to use translate:
  0) In Cosmos/Util/Atmnc3 do next  only once:
     ln -s somewhere/atmnc3/src3 src3
    where  somewhere.. is the directory where your
    atmnc3 is placed.
  1) Go to Interface;  make clean
  2) make
  3) ./translate$ARCH  arg  <  atmnc3-output-file
     or
     cat atmnc3-output-file | ./translate$ARCH  arg  
where
  arg is one of 1,2,3.  If not given, short usage will be shown.
   1==> only hadronic particles suited for Cosmos 1ry are 
        selected; content is sufficent for Cosmos use.
        Content summary is shown on stderr.
   2==> same as 1 but gammas and electrons, if any, are also selected
   3==> all atmnc3 output are selected  printed.  content are bit
        more than above case.  Content summary is shown on stderr.

  atmnc3-output-file is  the file-path to the Atmnc3's stdout.

  If each particle information obtainted with arg=1 or 2 is put in
a file, it may be used to make primaries in Cosmos execution.

  For that, 
1) in chookBgRun
    open the file.
2) in chookBgEvent
   a) define
     record /track/aTrack
     integer:: code, subcode, charge
     real(8):: dir(3),  Rxyz(3), llh(3), Et, cosz
     integer:: num1, num2
   b) read 1 line from the file as
      read(xx, *, end=zzzz) code, subcode, charge, dir(:), Et, Rxyz(:), llh(:), cosz
      where xx is the logical dev. # defined in 1).
      and do 
        call cmkptc(code, subcode, charge, aTrack.p)
        aTrack.p.fm.p(4) = Et    ! total energy
        aTrack.pos.xyz.r(:) = Rxyz(:)  ! (x,y,z) in the E-system (Earth-system)
        aTrack.vec.w.r(:) =  dir(:)   !  direction cos of the patcl in E-system.
        aTrack.where = 1  ! (ptcl is directed to first observation depth)
        call  cresetPrim2(aTrack)
	return
  zzzz  continue    !  zzzz should be some number
        call cinitStack   ! clean stack area
	call cqEventNo(num1, num2)   ! get current event #
	call cresetDestEvNo(num1-1)  ! reset destination event #
                               ! so that the run should stop



**Note:   momentum is set automatically inside cresetPrim2.
