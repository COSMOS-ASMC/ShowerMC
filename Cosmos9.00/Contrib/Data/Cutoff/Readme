Rigidity cut-off tables here were made by M.Honda 
(Baksan    Frejus    Gransaso  IMB       KGF       Kamioka   Sudbury)
The tables were made using his program.  The table format;

Column-wise : azimutal angles from 0 to 360 deg step 10 deg
Row-wise:     zenith angles from 0 to 180 deg step 10 deg


W-E was originally wrong because of p/p_Bar mistake.

awkfile is to revert W-E
