To test new Cosmos9.00 with old deflection routines.
  cputDeflection is separated from the old ccompPathEnd.f
  and placed here. Also old scattering routines for Air
  is added at the last part of the file.
To use this cputDeflection.f 
1) Makefile is modified so that this cputDeflected be used.
2) cSampMolReducedA.f90  is also needed  and it is module, so it is
   added at the top of Makefile.

3) 
In Cosmos9.00/Tracking,
     ln -s ../UC/Temp/cputDeflection.f cputDeflection.f 
     ln -s ../UC/Temp/cSampMolReducedA.f90 cSampMolReducedA.f90 
     Replace Makefile there by the one here (keep old one)

4) Activate  #ifdef xxxxxx inside ccompPathEnd.f in Tracking/
  (this is to ignore cputDeflection in ccompPathEnd.f. The
   place is just at the top of cputDeflecction subroutine.)
   Don't forget also you need activate #endif later)

   ccompPathEnd.f here is  disabled one.
   
   
5) The "make" will work; then  you can make userhook.

    But current situaiton is strange, # of particles appear is so small.
    Should be some bug.


6) To restore,  deactivate #ifdef xxxxxx ~ #endif  in ccompPathEnd.f
    restore Makefile so that cputDeflction.f and cSampMolReducedA.f90
    are  not to be compilled.
   (To avoid confusion, better to remove the link;
   rm  cpuDeflaction and cSampMolReduced.f90)
