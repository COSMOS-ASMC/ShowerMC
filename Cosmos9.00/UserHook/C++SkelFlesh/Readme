for skelton making.



This directory contains the all stuff for new skeleton-flesh method.

The new one is completely different from the old method.
The basic idea is to memorize nodal point information;
the nodal point means in principle, each interaction point of
particles.   At skeleton making time, only high energy particles
are traced, and low energy particles generated at the nodal
points are only memorized. At flesh time, those low energy 
partilces are really traced. Therefore, you need larger disk
memory as compared with the old method for which we need only
two random number seeds for fleshing.

However, the old method sometimes fails to reproduce the
high energy partilces at fleshing time due to how an
interaction code is organized. (Some code cannot generate
the same particles even if the initial random seeds,
the projectile and target are the same; it is dependent
on the previous particle generation).
If this condition happens, the old method cannot be used
without modifying the interaction code.

The new method is free from such danger.

Two Essential Programmes: 

     chookSkel.f:  to make skeleton
     chookFlesh.f:  to flesh skeleton

There are other utility programs.

     select.f: From the skeleton events you created,
               you may extract  some by requiring that
               the event number be inbetween specified two numbers,
               and creat new skeleton file.
  randomsel.f: Similar to select.f. Event selection is done by
               referring to another file in which event numbers
               to be extracted are memorized (from small to large).
	       Optionally, random seed may be contained in that 
               file like standard SeedFile.
   seeascii.f: skeleton information is written in binary.  To see
               the essential content of such file by converting
               it into ascii.  Event selection is done like
               select.f
 ranseeascii.f: similar to seeascii.f. Event selection is done
               like randomsel.f

     reanal.f: Although choolSkel.f does some level of event selection
	       when making skeleton,  you may re-analyse such skeleton
	       events by this program, and select special events to 
               be fleshed.  The program writes event numbers to be
               fleshed (optionally with two random seeds). 
               Then. you may use randomsel.f to extract desired 
               skeleton events for later fleshing.
	       What kind of events must be fleshed is dependent on
               the user, so that you must do some coding in
               cgetHES (see ========= part there).

   
How to do.

Skeleton making. 
    Important differences from the old method are:

      You have to specify Job = 'newskel'
      You have to fix the fleshing condition at skeleton making
      time.  At fleshing time, you may relax the condtions but
      generally cannot make the conditions more 'severe' 
      (Say,  if you give 100 GeV to the  minimum energy for future
       flesh-time, you cannot lower it at real flesh-time, but 
       you may change it to, say,  300 GeV).
      To fix the future fleshing conditons, you must give

         Generate2     (say, Generate2= 'em/as' while Generate='em')
         KEminObs2     (say, 1 GeV, while KEminObs = 1000 GeV)
         EndLevel2     (say, 3, while EndLevel= 1;  Leave these two
	                as zeros if you don't follow the particles
                        to lower depth at fleshing time than the
                        depth at skeleton making time. If you 
                        put, EndLevel=1, EndLevel2=3, you have to
                       give three depths; at skeleton making time,
                       particles are followed only the first depth
                      in this case.)
         WaitRatio     If hybrid AS is to be generated in flesh-time.
                     (or if you generate hybrid AS at skeleton-time;
	              though, this is probaly not the case).
         RatioToE0   Also for hybrid AS.
       ------
         ASDepthList You can give this later, but better to give
                     at skeleton time, if you need hybrid AS.

      Besides these, you have to give some user parameter values
      at the end of 'param' (template is paramSkel).  
      First one is 

         UserHookc = '@_skelnode','@_skelwork','noappend',

           which means 
           1) the file name to memorize skeleton node informtion,
           2)  working disk file name,
           3)  and 'append' or 'noappend' depending on
               whether you want to apped the node information when
               old node file  already exist. 

     Second one is

           UserHooki =    71,  70,   4       15,         3

           1)  71 and, 70 are logical disk file numbers for
               node info. and working file. Probalby no need to 
               change this.

           2)  The last three are used to judge if an event is
               to be kept as skeleton or not.
               4:  minium number of  e/g with E> KEminObs
              15:  //             hadrons/muons with E> KEminObs.
               3:  This specifies the depth where you judge the 
                   event is worth for skeleton. From  the upper
                   depth, you may count from 1.

     Third one is
        
            UserHookr =             16000,   150000,
   
        Also used to judge the event is worth for skeleton.

         16000:   sum e/g >  16000 GeV (16TeV) is needed for skeleton.
        150000:   sum had > 150 TeV is needed for skeleton.

Note:   e/g and hadron conditions are used with 'OR'.
      That is,
              Ng >= min && Sum Eg >= min
       or
              Nh >= min && Sum Eh >= min

     It may be better not to use hadron criteria; in that
     case put large values for hadrons threshold.


     If only these are too simple for your judgement, you may
     modify the chookSkel.f (The place is in chookEnEvent).
     See ================ lines.  You may also some more
     modifications in other places, and the place is probably
     somewhere inbetween ============= lines.


******* comile and execution  for skeleton *******
      make clean
      make -f chookSkel.mk
         Then, skel$(ARCH) is created.  $(ARCH) may be DECALPHA etc 
         depending on you host.
      
     skel$(ARCK)  < paramSkel


     This will make skeleton node info. file. It is binary; to see
     its essential info. you may use seeascii.f or ranseeascii.f
     If	give,

        UserHookc = '@_skelnode','@_skelwork','noappend',

     hostname_skelnode (hostname is your cpu's host name) will
     be the skeleton node file.

     Other importan files are those specified by
    
   'SkeletonFile'.
         (bad naming). This is the inut parameter file  for flesh-job.

   'SeedFile'
         Seed and event number of the Skeleton events are seen here.


********* complile and execution for flesh *******
    make clean
    make -f chookFlesh.mk
      This will create 
           flesh$(ARCH).

    Unlike the old method, you may simply feed parameter file,

	flesh$(ARCH) < paramForFlesh

   where paramForFlesh is the file specified by  'SkeletonFile'
   in you paramSkel.   So if you give,

   SkeletonFile = '@_paramforflesh'
      
   You may do

      flesh$(ARCH) < hostname_paramforflesh

   where hostname is your cpu host at skeleton making.

   Usually you don't need edit the parameter file for fleshing.

   However, you may want sometimes to change the skeleton node file name.
  (Say, if you make new node file by using select, reanal etc).

   You may also relax the fleshing conditions by editing the file.
  
   If you see the parameter file for fleshing,  you will see

        Job = 'newflesh'

   in stead of Job = 'flesh' used in the old method.

 ( As in the old method, you may specify the fleshing-parameter
   indirectly; you may edit paramSkel and change Job='newskel'
   to Job='newflesh' and feed it to flesh$(ARCH). Then, 
  fleshing-parameter file is automatically sought for).

  You may need to modify chookFlesh.f for your own purpose.
  The place for your coding is inbetween =========== lines.


********** compilation of utility programs and execution ******

     To compile xxxx.f
       (xxx.f = one of  

         randomsel.f    reanal.f      select.f
         ranseeascii.f  seeascii.f )

    use  
         make -f xxx.mk

    and this  will create 
        xxx$(ARCH)

    You may feed a 1 line data for these progams.

     echo  "......."  |  xxx$(ARCH)

   or   
        xxxx$(ARCH)  <  somefile

   where  'somefile' containes "......."

   What  should be "......" 

   select:  inputfile event1 event2  outputfile
          where
            inputfile:  is a skeleton node file
            event1:  first event number
            event2:  last event number
           outputfile: events with  event1 <= event #<= event2 
                       are selected from input and copied to this.

 randomsel: inputfile  numberfile flag  outputfile
           where
            inputfile: same as above.
            numberfile: contains event number to be copied into 
                       outputfile. 
             flag:     0 --> numberfile contains event number
                       in each line.
                     non 0 -->number  file format is the same as the
                       SeedFile.
            outputfile: see above.

  seeascii:  inputfile  event1 event2

              see select.  you may use the same one as
              select. The 4th value is neglected.

 ranseeascii:  inputfile  numberfile flag 
     
              see randeomsel.  you may use the same one as
              randomsel. The 4th value is neglected.
             
  reanal:    inputfile  event1 event2

      	      same as seeascii.

---------------------
How to confirm your skeleton is successfully fleshed.

This is rather difficult to see.  High energy partilces are
memorized in skeleton node file, so it is natural that you see
the same high energy particls at fleshing time.  The problem is
low energy particles at each node are really correct and well
treated in the fleshing job.  

	In the node, not every particle generated at interaction
is recorded; very low energy particles that are not needed in the
fleshing job are not recorded from the first.  This is to minumize
the node file volume, and that's why we cannot shift the fleshing
conditions to 'sever' side. 

The most convenient method of having ease for what you are doing is 
to take 'trace' at skeleton and flesh time.  

  As usual, trace info.  easily becomes large, you may do this
for relatively small energy ratios (E1ry/KEminObs).   
At skeleton making time,  trace of  only the high energy particles
are taken.  
At fleshing time, trace of only low energy particles is taken.
(Note that high energy particles are not produced in the flesh-job,
 but is read from the node file).

If you show both the trace information,  you can get the complete
trace picture.   If the low energy particles emerge from somewhere
not in the nodal part of high energy partilce trace, it means
the method fails.   

An example is  trace.eps in this directory.  Green lines are
for high energy partilces at skeleon making time and blue ones
for low energy partilces at fleshing time.  They all emearge
from the green lines.

Since it is enough to see that low energy particle trace appears
from high energy particle trace, we may use following parameter
values for check.

    DestEventNo = 5,
    Trace = 1
    KEminObs ~ E1ry/300.
    Generate = 'em'
 
    KEminObs2 ~ KEminObs/10
    Generate2 = 'em'  (don't inclde as; for too much trace)
