 tracefile outputdir  mint, maxt, dt, pixel, pixelinc, split, outtype mulalpha
 maxppt, rmax

tracefile:   path to the tracefile ; format is 
	x y z t  code
       .....

outputdir:  dirctory where time sorted data file(s) are placed.
	(ts00001.dat,... etc if split=t, else timesorted.dat is put)
mint:  minimum time above which data is manipulated. (m. mint/c is
	 actual time in s where c is the light velocity in m/s).
maxt:  maximum time below //                      
	   (m. maxt/c //                 ).
dt:    unit step of the time (same unit as mint,maxt)
pixel:  If two points are within this distance (m), they are supposed
	 to be displayed in the same pixel.
       (|r1 -r2|< pixel, (for r= (x,y,z)) )

pixelinc:  If the array becomes full to store x,y,z ..  we try thinningr
	by using pixel defined as above.   In some case the thinning
	dose not work; then we try brute thinning using larger pixel
	value by multiplying pixelinc to current  pixel.  This continues
	until we get free space in the array.
	

split:  If t, we will make files
	 ts00001.dat,  ts00002.dat,...(outtype
	LSB bit = on)
	
	or ts
	 corresponding to time sliced data.
        IF f, we will make only one file "timesorted.dat" where one
	 time bin data to the other one
	is separated by a blank.

      data format is
     x y z  code
     x y z  code
        ......

for split date. For Non split data.

     x y z  code
        ......

outtype LSB bit 1--> output  x,y,z,code,chg;
                0--> no output of above
   		filename is  ts000001.dat etc or timesorted.dat
        2nd bit 1--> output  skel file for Geomview 
                0--> no output of above
		filename is ts000001.skel or timesoreted.skel

mulalpa   : alpha factor in colortab  is multiplied by this factor


maxppt    :  max particles per time.  maxp in Zprivate.f is the
	     limit at each time plane, but if you want make it  less,
	      you may give this.  Default is maxp
    	     (0 is converted to maxp).

rmax      :   x**2+y**2 > rmax**2  are discaded

matrix:  Primary axis unit vector in Detctor system.
       Used to convert (x,y) in det. system into primary system.
