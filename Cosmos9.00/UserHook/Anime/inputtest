tracefile:   path to the tracefile ; format is 
	x y z t  code
       .....

outputdir:  dirctory where time sorted data file(s) are placed.
	(ts00001.dat,... etc if split=t, else timesorted.dat is put)
mint:  minimum time above which data is manipulated. (m. mint/c is
	 actual time in s where c is the light velocity in m/s).
maxt:  maximum time below //                      
	   (m. maxt/c //                 ).
dt:    unit step of the time (same unit as mint,maxt)
pixel:  If two points are within this distance (m), they are supposed
	 to be displayed in the same pixel.
       (|r1 -r2|< pixel, (for r= (x,y,z)) )
dothin: If t,  and if two or more points are judeged as being in the
	 same pixel, only one is left and others are removed from
	 the output. T is normally recomended.
	If f, no thinning is tried.
split:  If t, we will make files
	 ts00001.dat,  ts00002.dat,...(outtype
	LSB bit = on)
	
	or ts
	 corresponding to time sliced data.
        IF f, we will make only one file "timesorted.dat" where one
	 time bin data to the other one
	is separated by a blank.

      data format is
     x y z  code
     x y z  code

outtype LSB bit 1--> output  x,y,z,code,chg;
                0--> no output of above
   		filename is  ts000001.dat etc or timesorted.dat
        2nd bit 1--> output  skel file for Geomview 
                0--> no output of above
		filename is ts000001.skel or timesoreted.skel

mulalpa   : alpha factor in colortab  is multiplied by this factor

deltaN:   : If the number of  particles at a given time plane exceed
	    maxppt(see below), thinning is tried according to dothin.  
	    For a
	    huge shower, thinning may not work at last.  In such a case, 
	    a brute thinning is forced;  particles at the 
	   central part of x, y, z are thinned by random probability of
	   0.5.  The centeral part is defined to be the +/- deltaN/2
	   from the central value of x, y,  z, respectively. 

maxppt    :  max partcles per time.  maxp in Zprivate.f is the
	     limit at each time plane, but if you want make it  less
	     than that, you may give this.  Default is maxp
	  (0 is converted to maxp).
