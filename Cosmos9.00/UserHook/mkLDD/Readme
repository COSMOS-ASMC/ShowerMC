What can I do for you here.

1) LDD making.  
	Be sure that you have done 'make' in UserHook/Hist.
	This is needed to make library for histograming.
	'Hist' can be used only with Intel Fortran.
	Then, make clean; make will create a binary.
	Edit param, primary. 
	In 'param' specify UserHookc vaule, among others.
	(For sge job submission:
	Edit submit32At32.sh so that your user ID appears.
	qsub -t 1:xx submit32At32.sh
	Here if  xx is 10, it  means 10 jobs. 
	 submitxxx depends on your envronment.
2) In a directory where the ouptut of the above process
	is stored.
a)  If you want to check wheather your environment is vaild
	for Cosmos or not, use the inclined primary case.
	
	$COSMOSTOP/UserHook/mkLDD/check.csh
	If you see a very short line for some of files
	and/or non negtive bins, the environment is NG.

    Also you may better check the result by
	$COSMOSTOP/UserHook/mkLDD/checkNe.csh
	If you see Nemax far from 6x10^10 (E0 eV/1e20),
	the environment is NG.

	Once the envrionement is found valid, you don't need
	to this task again.

b)  If you want to find max/min age  or max/min cog values
	among the current .hyb files (at a given depth),
	
	$COSMOSTOP/UserHook/mkLDD/showMinMaxAge.csh depth

c)  If you want to show a line of a given depth of each
	.hyb file,  use

	$COSMOSTOP/UserHook/mkLDD/showMinMaxAge.csh depth

d)  If you want to analyse a given -t.hist file and get
	a file like tf.data, use
	
	make -f procTime.mk
	./procTimexxxx 1 2 0  some-t.hist > tfx.data

	tf.data would contain data as shown below
         (1st layer means the 1st layer
            specified in UserHookc; normally only 1 layer is
	    specified so this is normally 1).
	  The 2nd column (-1.657E+00 etc), shows the time in ns,
	where the integral  (from small) time distribution reachs
	5% of the total at a given web bin (rindex i means r=0.01x10**((i-1)*0.1)
	in m.u).  Fai index 1 is for (-15,15) deg, 2 for (15,45)....
	The next column is for 10%...
	First gamma data, next electron, muon, hadron data follow.


	
  1   1   1         <---- fai=(-15,15), gamma,  1 st layer
  1 -1.667E+00 -1.631E+00 -1.569E+00 ...  <-- web rindex 1 
  2 -2.104E+00 -2.049E+00 -1.965E+00 ...  <--            2
....
 40 -3.838E+03 -3.402E+03 -2.487E+03 ...  <--           40
      5 %         10 %       20% ..  .90%
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0                   <--        end
  2   1   1        <--- fai=(15,45), gamma  1 st layer
  1 -1.492E+00 -1.45... <-- web rindex 1 
...

  1  2    1        <--- fai(-15,15),  electron  1st layer


-------------
The time data obtained as above may be compared with
FDD time  data as follows.

A)  Goto /TAMCDB/C/src/Examples/RawTimeInWeb
	and get histogram data. To do so
	you may give a layer (or layer range),
	or age or cog. (for age or cog, a layer
	of which age or cog is closest  is chosen.
	For further details, read Readme there.
	The histogram data thus obtained can be
	put to procTime as in 2 d).
B)  tf.data can be processed by using 
	awk -f getTimeAtFai.awk fai=n code=m |
	awk -f getTimeAtFrac.awk nth=p > somefile

	where  n specifies fai region. (1-->(-15,15).. 12-->(315,345))
	m for ptcl code (1-->g, 2-->e, 3-->mu, 4-->hadron).
	p for percentage. 2-->5%, 3-->10%, 4-->20% 5-->30%
	                 6-->40%, 7-->50%, 8-->60% 9-->70%
	                10-->80%, 11-->90%).

	somefile is ready for plotting or fitting.
	You may compare fomefile from LDD and from FDD.
