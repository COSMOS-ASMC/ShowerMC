1) assemble hist data, 
	prepare setupenvHist.sh
	./assemHist.sh
2) assemble hybrid data,
	prepare setupenvHyb.sh
	./assembHyb.csh
3) assemble nrfai data,
	./assembNrfai.csh

4) Reduce file size in each /tmp/$USER
        ./reduceEach.bin.atsite.sh

5) Gather data somedir
	./assemDat.sh  somedir  (create files accorging to layer nubmers;
	               to be put by $TAMCDB/sbin/mdCreatFDDBnew.csh)
or	
	./assemDatNew.sh somedir.  Basically the same as the next one
	  but don't gather the files in the remote host to the temporary
	  directory and concatinate directory.
 
	./assemDat2onefile.sh  somedir (create one .dat file to be
	          put by  $TAMCDB/sbin/mdCreatFDDB.csh)
	This one will need longer time.
-----------
a) To convert binary hist file to ascii with
	consistent id key (i.e, with correct age and cog_norm_depth)


b) To convert binary hist file to ascii (without
	id correction)
