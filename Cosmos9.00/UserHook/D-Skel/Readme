SkelFlesh:  make skeleton for distributed job; param  template is
	paramSkelForDistJob. Fleshing is not done in this directory.

Smash:     Skeleton made in SkeleFlesh is smashed into N files for N cpu

FleshBase:  At N cpu, execute jobs for one event or pluaral events.
	    This dose not assumed to take histogram
FlesHist:   At N cpu, execute jobs for one event or pluaral events.
	    This is intended to take histogram. 
Assemble:
	Assemble  N files  of hybrid data to get one unified file.
	Assemble  N files  of hist data to get one unified file.
	convert binary histogram  file into ascii file

This directory contains stuff for distributed job to simulate a very high
energy event with a number of PC's, thus enabling Full Monte Carlo simulation
of very  high energy events for which one cpu would need a desperate long
computation time.
