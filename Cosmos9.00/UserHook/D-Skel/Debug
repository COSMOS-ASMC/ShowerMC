2) Skeleton by Cosmos is fed to CosmosPrev;  bad result

   good
-------
5) To confirm azimuth angle dependence, Azimuth=( 0,0) is
   tried at CosmosPrev. (lib is good one).
   O.K 
6) Once again 1) is tried.   lib is by Cosmos. SkelFlesh/Zprivate.h
   is from CosmosPrev.
  (diffrence is only the size of  NpMax; used one is larger  ).
 6-1: Sparam is not current one:   but OK
 6-2: Sparam is copied from CosmosPrev:   OK
 6-3: //              SkelFlesh is by Cosmsos; from Smash tried.
       OK
7)     Once more 2) is tried.   Every thing is by Cosmos
     bad


8)  copy SkelFlesh of CosmosPrev in Cosmos and do everything in Cosmos
     bad (azimuth=0)
9)  same but azimuth=280
     bad.

-------
10) cinteraction.f in Cosmos is saved cinteraction.fCosmos
   and cinteraction in CosmosPrev is copied instead.
   It is recompiled. and SkelFlesh is executed.
