       This is the parameter file to control softenning or related stuff.
       The file path is $COSMOSTOP/UserHook/modifyX/softenparam.dat
       softenparam.dat will be seen in $EPICSTOP/Util/Gencol/
       which is the link to the original shown above.

       Softeinnig:
       If we find a pi/K/eta with x>xth,
              apply softening with the prob. of (x-xth)**pw (pw=0.1 default).
              Softening is done by splitting  the particle into two by
              calling csplitMeson.  The sum of two particle is made to
              be the same as the original particle. However, momentum 
              cannot be conserved: the two particle will have the same
              Pt as the original one and 3 memeta are adjuested to 
              satisfy P^2 + m^2 =E^2.


      data must be written after next -----------
      mode 3   / 3  means data for 'mode' is 3. '/' must exist.   3 after / 
                    is some typical data.  
                    *******The data must start from the 2nd  column*******
                    The order of data is arbitrary. 
-------------------------------------------------------
 mode       0   /  3
        mode=0      don't do any cut/modification of X
        mode=1      discard all pi/K with x>xth. 
                    However, if the incident is pi/K the highest
                    energy pi/K, resp, is untouched.
        mode=2      discard only pi0 with x> xth
        mode=3      soften pi/K/eta  spectrum; 
                    If their X is > xth, this is applied with some 
                    probabiltiy. (see xth)
                    (except for the leading pi/K when incident is pi/K; 
                     see leaingPiK)
       mode=-3      the user must supply own modification routine 
 xth   0.01   /  0.05
       X over this, we apply cut or modification.  Modification is 
       done with probability of (x-xth)**pw
 pw    0.25   / 0.5
           softening is determined by comparing uniform random number u
           and   (x-xth)**pw.
           pw in (x-xth)**pw is smaller, stronger softening takes place
 repeat   2.5   /  1.5 apply the simple softenning repeat times
                for one event if the event has pi/K/eta with X> Xth. 
                the odd number is probabilistic. If negative,
                positive number is taken  to be as Poisson average.

 E0th  1000   / 500
           500 GeV  over this we apply cut/mod.
           if make this 10 TeV, effect after shower max
           decreases even for  E1ry=10^19 eV
 fwbw  3   / 3
           Used in Gencol; modification is applied to
           1--> forward only 2--> backword only
           3--> both ; However, 1 is used when
           Cosmos output (in cms) is the target, irespectively of
           fwbw.  
 special  f   / f 
                This is used olny in modifyX of  Cosmos. but not used in Gencol of Epics.
                In Cosomos, it is used to see the x-dist. of
                pi, K, eta  at the first interaction; 
                For that, make this  t and 
                ***set next in parm*** (don't forget to restore
                them to the default if special=f is reset.
