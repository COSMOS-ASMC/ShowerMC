This is a variant of UserHook/mkLDD used for the TA M.C simulation
but includes one special feature which is intended to see the effect
of a softer x-distribution than the original one. 
Various features used in the normal execution of mkLDD are disabled
by the specification in the "param" file and the default output is
only .hyb files from which you can see the transition of Ne, Ng etc.

 	
1) Compilation.
  Be sure that you have done 'make' in UserHook/Hist (once for all)
  This is needed to make library for histograming althoug in default
  we don't take histograms.

  Then, if needed, edit csoftenPiK.f and adjust  parameters there. 
  They are   hard-wirted and cannot be controled by input data.
  Then, 
   make clean; make
2) Set parameters in "param", and fix the primary by "primary" file
   Essential ones: 
      Thinning parameter.
  EthinRatio.  At the top part of param, the standard values
          are shown. 
       EthinRatio = 1.0e-7*A, 1.e5*(E0/1.e20eV),
       However, to see only the transition curve and to get Xmax,
       the standard one is too small so you can use (1.e-5*A, 1.e7(E0/1e20eV)
       Don't use more rough values. 
       (2.e-6A, 1.e6(E0/1.e20eV))  would be much better but need much cpu 
       time.
  UserHookc = '0 /',
     'f, f,  f /',
    '~/CosmosData/Xmax/p/E1.0e18/#2'       
        The 3rd line specifies the output file location. #2 means
        the file name which is formed by using process #. .hyb
        is added.  e.g.  3492103.hyb will be created.

3)  After .hyb's are generated, you may goto Cosmos/Util/Minuit
	Then, "make clean; make' there (once for all).
	Then, go further  Util/tranfit-xexp, "make clean; make" there
	See Readme there.
