The IBM-AIX user should have already  issued the command IBM so that
chook.f.org has been created to keep the original chook.f and
current chook.f is a copy of chook.f.IBM.

1) To make the executable, cosmos${ARCH}
  make clean
  make [ -f chook.mk ]

2) If you don't have /tmp/loginname directory, make it
(loginname is your login name)

3) If this is successful, then you can run it by

  cosmos{$ARCH} < param

This will show some output on the screen and put particle
track info (trace) in /tmp/loginname/trace1, trace2.  

4)  You can display the trace by gnuplot.  
   Cosmos/Util/slide will work for display.

  The format of the output is:

  x y z code E charge
  x y z code E charge
  x y z code E charge

  x y z code E charge
  x y z code E charge
  x y z code E charge
  x y z code E charge
  x y z code E charge
...

Two blank lines are to separate the segment of lines. 
Consecutive data lines make one continuos track, though
it may have zigzag shape.  code is the paticle code.
1-gamma 2-electron 3-mu  4-pi  5-kaon 6-nucleon
7-neue  8-neumu
