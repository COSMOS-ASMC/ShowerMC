To compile and get an executable, simple type
	make
which will cteate  cosmos$ARCH, where $ARCH is the one
specified in site.config.  You will need to do
	mkdir /tmp/YOURID
before running the jot as
	cosmos$ARCH < param


If compilation fails, read the following.

c++ code may run or may not run depending on the environment.
It depends on the version of gcc, OS.
 Intel Fortran. with Red Hat Linux 7.3, 9.0  the
 C++ User Interface went well. 

Stuff in Test/ include varous tests I tried during making up 
the interface.
**********
You have to change the IFC compiler part in Makefile.
Also you have to make the appropiate  ifclib file.
(For intel fortran, you would have to change the -L part,
say -L/usr/intel/...)

To see what specification is needed,
 you may make a simple fortran program, and
compile it with -v option. Then, you will see what
libraries are needed to link Fortran programs and
you may put them in ifclib.
*********


If you change Z.....h in cosmos, you must also change the
corresponding Z...h in include.

 -------------

The commands used in Makefile are

c++ -c ../cmain.cc -I../../include
c++ -c  chookHybAS.cc -I../../include
c++ -c ../ctemplCeren.cc -I../../include
c++ -c chook.cc -I../../include

 /lib/cpp -C -P -traditional -I$COSMOSINC ../cmymain.f > /tmp/cmymain.f
ifc -c  /tmp/cmymain.f


c++ cmain.o cmymain.o chook.o chookHybAS.o ctemplCeren.o -L$COSMOSTOP/lib/PCLinuxIFC -lcosmos `cat ifclib `

will create a.out. So you may run the program as
 ./a.out < param  
(you will need to mkdir /tmp/YOURID with standard param).


-------------------------------
IFC:
 append _.
 for lib, cc ...  ` cat ifclib `

 cat ifclib must come last


-----------
	
icrsrv: 
In C code,
 use  the same capital/small letter as in fortran.
	but apend _ in each external name.

use library 
-L/usr/lib32/mips4/r10000 -L/usr/lib32/mips4 -L/usr/lib32 -dont_warn_unused -lfortran -lffio -lftn -lm


--------------
OS X absoft fortran
In C code;
use capital letter for external name without appending _

use library;
  -L/usr/local/Absoft/lib/ -lfio -lf77math
