`cat ifclib ` dosen't expand $COSMOSTOP so that we must show the
cosmos library in the command line directory.


Be carefull to use strncpy;

To append some string (s) to another string (fs) made in Fortran;
Character length from for Fortran is needed as the last part of
the argument list; it must be given by value. (not by pointer
as in all  other arguments).

  extern int klena_(char *, int );

  char x[20];
  strcpy(x,fs);
  x[ klena_(x, strlen(x)) ] = '\0';
  strcat(x, s);
  strcpy(fs, x);
