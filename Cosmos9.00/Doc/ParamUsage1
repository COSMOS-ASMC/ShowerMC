The description of parameters frequently used:  &Param data
----------------------------------------------------------

<<ASDepthList>>   real*8 
 This is DepthList for AS observation. Used only if Generate contains 
 "as". See DepthList. 

<<ASHeightList>>   real*8 
 This is HeightList for Air Shower observ. Used only if Generate contains 
 "as". See HeightList. 

<<Azimuth>>   complex*16 
 Range of azimuthal angle in deg. Say, (0, 45). Default is (0,360). 
 Can be such as (300., 390.). Used when Za1ry is 'is'\newline 
 If ObsPlane=3 (spherical), this is used to show the half opening angle 
 range where the primary injection position is uniformly distributed 
 on a sphere. The center of the opening angle is (Latit, Longit, HeightOfInj). 
 In this case, for the upper opening angle, min( Imag(Azimuth),180.) is used. 

<<BaseTime>>   real*8 
 Rough cpu time needed for completing one event (say, for protons, or 
 gamma rays) with energy BaseErg. The cpu time estimation is based on 
 A * ( E1ry par nucleon )**BasePower / BaseErg * BaseTime, where A is mass number 
 (for nucleus; otherwise 1). 

<<Cont>>   logical 
 If T, continuation from a previous job is assumed. Contfile content is used. 

<<ContFile>>   character*70 
 Job continuation information file (full or relative path). 
 default is "ContInfo". This will be created when job 
 is finished normally. 

<<CosZenith>>   complex*16 
 Range of cos(zenith angle). Say, (0.5, 1.0). Used when Za2ry is 'is' 
 If ObsPlane=3 (spherical), real(CosZenith) must be $>$0, and means 
 the zenith angle range at the incident point (not in Exyz system). 
 In that case, azimuth is 0 to 2pi. 

<<CutOffFile>>   character*70 
 Geomagnetic cut-off file 

<<Ddelta>>   real*8 
 SourceDec $\pm$ Ddelta is the region for 'aps' (deg). 

<<DeadLine>>   character*8 
 The dead line before which the job should terminate. 
 Should be given like '10.11.15' which means the nearest 10th, 11 O'clock, 
 15 min. Not used if Within has non zero value. 

<<DepthList>>   real*8 
 Depth List of Observation level in kg/m$^2$. If $< 0$, HeightList has priority. 
 (See HeightList) 

<<DestEventNo>>   integer 
 2 integers: Final event no. to be generated and events to be generated 
 in the current run. If negative, their absolute is used and counting 
 includes discarded ones due to rigidity cutoff. 
 If DestEventNo(2)=0, DestEventNo(1) is used. If it is negative, only 
 DestEventNo(2) is checked to see events in the current run. For the 
 flux calculation, negative ones are better. 

<<DtGMT>>   real*8 
 Difference of the local time of the observation place from GMT (hour). 

<<Freec>>   logical 
 if F, the first interaction point is forced to be the injection point else 
 the interaction poin is randomly sampled. 

<<Generate>>   character*16 
 specify what should be generated \newline 
 1) Electro-magnetic cascade(em), \newline 
 2) one dimensional hybrid AS(as/qas) and/or \newline 
 3) AS Lateral distribution(lat). \newline 
 If Generate= ' ', hadronic cascade shower is generated. \newline 
 For example, you may give as follows: \newline 
 Generate='em,as' or 'em/as' (order/case/separator insensitive) is to generate EM-cascade and AS. \newline 
 Generate='as' will generate AS with some adequate EM cascade (EM cascade is automatically generated 
 so that hybrid A.S can be observed, but the minimum energy in EM cascade is independent of KEminObs). \newline 
 If 'qas' is given, quick generation of AS for heavy primaries is tried. See chookASbyH.f 

<<HeightList>>   real*8 
 Height of observation levels in m. This is made from DepthList internally. 
 I.e., this one is usually not an input. However, if the DepthList values are 
 negative, this is used as input and corresponding DepthList is computed internally. 

<<HeightOfInj>>   real*8 
 The vertical height of primary injection point (m). 
 If this is $<$ deepest obs. level and zeinth angle of primary is $< 0$, 
 the primary is assumed to be upgoing even if Reverse =0. 
 NOTE: BorderHeightH must be given explicitly in this case. 

<<Hidden>>   logical 
 Make T, if hidden parameters are to be written. 

<<IncMuonPolari>>   logical 
 if T, consider muon polarization 

<<InitRN>>   integer 
 Initial random number seed. 2 integers. If InitRN(1) $<$ 0, file dev \# 14 
 is assumed to have pairs of IR in each row, and they are read to 
 initialize each event. This feature is ignored when Job = 'flesh' or 
 'newflesh'. The \# 14 file should be opened by the user routine 
 (chookBgRun). This is almost debug purpose.\newline 
 If InitRn(2)$<$0, timer, hostname and process number are used for the 
 initialization. 

<<IntModel>>   character*64 
 Interaction model description. Usage was changed from v6.0. 
 One may list code name and upper energy bound for the code.\newline 
 E.g. IntModel = '"dpmjet3"' ; to specify the dpmjet3 in the entire energy region 
 IntModel = '"dpmjet3" 100 "nexus2" to specify dpmjet3 at $<$ 100 GeV and nexus2 
 at E$>$100 GeV \newline 
 IntModel = '"nucrin" 5 "fritiof1.6" 500 "adhoc" to specify Nucrin, 
 fritiof1.6, and ad-hoc model in the respective energy region. This 
 corresponds to the old IntModel='int1'. \newline 
 IntModel = '"nucrin" 5 "fritiof1.6" 10 "fritiof7.02" and \newline 
 IntModel = '"dpmjet3"' \newline 
 are most promissing models that fit the observed 
 data (muons and gamma rays) for which the primary is well known by 
 BESS and AMS observations ($<$ 100 GeV). 

<<Job>>   character*10 
 What kind of job you are going to do.\newline 
 =' ' (default). nothing special.\newline 
 ='skeleton'. Makes skeleton. \newline 
 ='flesh'. Flesh skeleton events. See manual.\newline 
 ='newskel' \newline 
 ='newflesh' see manual. \newline 

<<KEminObs>>   real*8

<<LatitOfSite>>   real*8 
 Latitude of the deepest observation level in degree. East is positive. 

<<LongitOfSite>>   real*8 
 Longitude of the deepest observation level in degree. North is positive. 

<<LpmEffect>>   logical 
 If t, the LPM effect is considered when Ee $>$ LpmBremEmin for electrons and 
 Eg $>$ LpmPairEmin for gamma rays. 

<<MinPhotoProdE>>   real*8 
 Below this energy, no photo-prod of hadron. See also PhotoProd. 

<<ObsPlane>>   integer 
 How to observe particles. \newline 
 0$ \Rightarrow $ no detector plane is used for observation. BorderHeightL 
 and BorderHeightH are used to detect particles. This is for, say, neutrino 
 observation. See BorderHeight{L,H}. However, the primary is directed to 
 the deepest depth. \newline 
 1,-1$ \Rightarrow $ detector at the observation place is horizontal. Note 
 that the horizontal means not tangential plane, but rather a spherical surface \newline 
 2,-2$ \Rightarrow $ detector is perpendicular to the primary. \newline 
 3$ \Rightarrow $ spherical observation. See text. \newline 
 For ObsPlane={1,2}, the user observation routine will receive coordinate values in 
 the corresponding detector system. However, if it is 0, 3 or negative, Exyz values 
 are obtained. 

<<OneDim>>   integer 
 If 0, 3 dimensional simulation. if $\ge$1, one 
 dimensional simulation is performed. \newline 
 1: onedim without use of table. \newline 
 2: table is used for thickness $ \leftrightarrow$ length conversion. if cos $<$ .5 \newline 
 3: table is always used for any angle. 
 ( for height $>$ 30 km, table is not used in any case). 

<<PhotoProd>>   logical Obsolete.
 Switch. if .false., no photo prod. of hadron is considered at all. 
 See also MinPhotoProdE. 

<<PrimaryFile>>   character*70 
 Primary Spectrum data file (full or relative path) 

<<SeedFile>>   character*70 
 File to contain the initial random numbers for those events to 
 which you want to flesh. You can create the file by calling 
 cwriteSeed in a user hook routine (say, in chookEnEvent) at 
 skeleton making time. Default is 'Seed'. For a normal run with 
 Job=' ', if SeedFile is not ' ', two integer initial random numbers 
 and the event number are automatically output on the speicfied disk file. 

<<SkeletonFile>>   character*70 
 Skeleton information file (full or relative path). created if Job = 
 'skeleton'. Default is 'skeletonParam'. This is the Namelist data 
 referred by Cosmos automatically if Job='flesh' is specified. For 
 Job='flesh', you have to modify some part of this file. 

<<SourceDec>>   real*8 
 Source declination of point source.(deg) 

<<ThinSampling>>   logical 
 if F, thinsampling is not tried. if T, alla Hillas thinning.
 It could be used with skeleton/flesh method, but not tested
 yet.  See also EthinRatio. 

<<TimeStructure>>   logical 
 If T, time information is computed 

<<Trace>>   integer

 $<$50 $\rightarrow$ x, y, z in 'xyz' system.\newline 
 $<$60 $\rightarrow$ x,y, in 'xyz' and z in kg/m2\newline 
 61-100 $\rightarrow$ for Cherenkov observation. For Coord system, subtract 60.\newline 
 if the value is even, binary output is made on TraceDev.\newline 
 if the last digit is 1 or 2, trace is always taken. if the last digit is 3 or 4, trace is taken 
 only if the particle is located below the heighest observation depeth. 
 $>$ 101 $\rightarrow$ subtract 100 and apply the above, but chookTrace or chookCeren are used.\newline 
 Primary system: Origin is the deepest detector. Z-axis is the primary direction. 
 X-axis is Z x Vertical axis. X-Y plane is orthogonal to the primary.\newline 
 Detector system: origin is the deepest detector. Z-axis is the vertical one. X-axis is 
 directed to the magnetic east. X-Y plane is horizontal.\newline 
 z in kg/m$^2$ : Vertical depth in kg/m$^2$ above the deepest detector to the particle.

 TraceDir is not used. You have to open the disk file at chookbgRun 
 It can by binary or ascii file depending on Trace value. 

<<WaitRatio>>   real*8

 The job should end within this minutes from now. Default is 99999. 
 If 0 is given, DeadLine is used. 

<<YearOfGeomag>>   real*8

<<Za1ry>>   character*4 
 Specify the primary angle sampling method by one of 'is', 'ps' or 'aps'.\newline 
 "cos".  isotropic 1ry. i.e,  cos dcos is assumed.  \newline
 "is" is isotropic. The range is by CosZenith. Almost no use\newline 
 "ps" is for point source (See also SourceDec)\newline 
 "aps" is around point source (See also SourceDec and Ddelta) \newline 
 If ObsPlane=3 (spherical), this must be "cos".
