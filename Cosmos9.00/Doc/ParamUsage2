 assumed to exist and Cosmos tries to get the value of that env variable. 
 If the value is obtained, the \verb/@/ in \verb/@_/ or \verb/@./ 
 expressing a part of a file name is replaced by that value. 
 (default is blank and in that case the \verb/@/ is replaced by 
 the host name where the job runs.) 

<<AtmosFile>>   character*100

<<BackAngLimit>>   real*8 
 If the cosine of the angle between a particle and the primary becomes smaller than 
 this value, the particle is discarded. See also BorderHeighH. If you give a value 
 less than -1.0, such rejection will never happen. Default is -1.0 

<<BaseErg>>   real*8 
 See BaseTime. The default is 1000 (GeV). 

<<BasePower>>   real*8 
 See BaseTime. Default is 1.0

 If a particle goes higher than this, discard it. This should be larger than 
 HeightOfInj or 0. 
 If 0, it is adjusted to be the same as HeightOfInj. NOTE: For upgoin primary cases, you have 
 to set this one explicitly. 

<<BorderHeightL>>   real*8

 air shower generation. The value would be dependent on the 
 experimental purpose. The default value, 81 MeV, is bit too 
 small in many applications (The air shower size is overestimated). 
 Comparisons of sizes by the hybrid method and by the full Monte 
 Carlo tell that \newline 
 $N_e$ (full 3-D M.C) $ < N_e$ (hybrid AS with $E_c=81$ MeV ) $ < N_e$ (full 1-D M.C) 
 $ {\ \lower-1.2pt\vbox{\hbox{\rlap{$<$}\lower5pt\vbox{\hbox{$\sim$}}}}\ } 
 N_e$(hybrid AS with $E_c={76}$ MeV) at around shower maximum. 
 Hybrid AS is always essentially 1-D.

<<EndLevel2>>   integer 
 Don't worry. This is system use. 

<<EndLevel>>   integer 
 Used for skeleton/flesh-out job. In a normal job, system default value 0 is reset by 
 the system to be the max number of observation levels. (=NoOfSites). Its real use is in such a 
 skeleton/flesh-out job that one first follows the particles up to some high depth and later chooses 
 events and flesh them out to deeper depths. In such a skeleton-making job, the user must give the 
 depth list which is used flesh-out job, too. In the skeleton job, particle tracking is terminated 
 at the level specified by EndLevel. In such a flesh-out job, the user must give a larger value 
 or 0 to EndLevel 

<<ErrorOut>>   integer 
 Error output logical dev number. 

<<Es>>   real*8 
 Modified scattering constant. 19.3d-3 GeV 

<<Eta2Pi0>>   real*8 
 eta/pi0 ratio. this is used to see the effect due to non-decay of pi0 
 at very high energies. Only source of h.e gamma can be eta and LPM may work 
 for them. default is 0.2 

<<EthinRatio>>   real*8 dimension 2.
 if ThinSamplig = T, thin sampling is performed with the following conditions:

 EthinRatio(1) $>$ 0, then Ethin(1)=EthinRatio(1) * PrimaryEnergy(/nucleon) \\
 EthinRatio(1) $<$ 0, then Ethin(1)=abs(EthinRatio(1))

 Ethin(2)=thinRatio(2)($>$) is taken to be the maximum permitted weight
  of a particle.  

 Thinsampling is performed when energy of a particle is $<$ Ethin(1) and
 its weight is $<$ Ethin(2).   (Note, even though resultant weight of a
 particle may  have a larger weight value than Ethin(2)).
 To see longitudinal development,
 EthinRatio(1) could be as large as 5$\times 10^{-5}$.
 (To see lateral distribution  etc, problematic). 
 For Fe of $10^{20} eV, with this EthinRatio(1), the maximum weight
 becomes as large as $3\times 10^{8}$.  In this case, we may
 put EthinRatio(2)=$10^6$.

<<HowIntNuc>>   integer 
 If 0, the number of interacting nucleons among a projectile heavy nucleus is 
 determined as the number of first collision of each interacting nucleon inside 
 the nucleus. If 1, the number is determined as the total number of collisions 
 including successive interactions. Default is 1. (There is uncertaninity in 
 interpretation of the formula; value 1 gives larger number of interacting

 and KnockonRatio.

 To control Lund program. LundPara(1) is set to kfr(7); kfr(7)=1 is for Frititof 
 hard scattering. 2 is for Pythia H.S. 2 gives higher multiplicity but shape is 
 strange. Default is 1. LundPara(2) is set to kfr(12): 1 by for OPAL hard scattering 
 parameterization. 2 by DELPHI. Default is 2. (2 gives bit higher PT). LundPara(3) 
 $>$ 0 $\Rightarrow$ Pythia message will appear. LundPara(4) $>$ 0 Fritiof 
 message; both on ErrorOut. LundPara(5) =0 $\Rightarrow$ All kaons collisions 
 are treated as pi- in Fritiof, else they are treated by adhoc model as they are. 

<<MagBrem>>   integer 
 If 0, no magnetic bremsstrahlung is considered. \newline 
 if 1 and Ee $>$ MagBremEmin, energy loss due to magnetic brems is considered \newline 
 if 2 and Ee $>$ MagBremEmin, real sampling of gamma is performed. \newline 
 (note, actually upsilon is referred further). 
 if generate='as' with really high energy primaries, WaitRatio 
 must be made small so that WaitRatio*E0 $\sim$ MagBremEmin 

<<MagBremEmin>>   real*8 
 E $>$ this, magnetic bremsstrahlung by electrons may be considered. However, if 
 MagBrem = 0, not considered at all \newline 
 MagBrem = 1, total energy loss due to brems is considered. \newline 
 MagBrem = 2, gamma energy is sampled actually. \newline

 HowGeoMag=2 and HightOfInj $\sim$ 5000 km are desirable. 

<<MagPairEmin>>   real*8 
 E $>$ this, magnetic pair creation by gamma may be considered. However, if 
 MagPair = 0, not considered at all. \newline 
 MagPair = 1, pair creation is sampled. \newline 
 However, again, actual occurrence will be dependent on the angle between 
 B and photon direction. 

<<MaxComptonE>>   real*8 
 Above this energy, Compton scattering is neglected. 

<<MaxPhotoE>>   real*8 
 Above this energy, photoelectric effect is neglected.

 1$\rightarrow$ use Moli\`ere scattering for non-electrons (default)\newline 
 2$\rightarrow$ use Moli\`ere scattering for all charged particles.\newline 
 If negative, anglular-correlated displacement is made to be 0 since Moli\`ere 
 theory cannot give it. (if $\ge 0$, we use Gaussian approximation for correlation). 

Moliere=-1 is recommended for normal jobs.  At very shallow depths
(say < 1 r.l)  Moliere=1 is better.

 2$\rightarrow$ (Default value). similar to 1 but as the continuous loss only v $<$ vmin=10$^{-3}$ of 
 fractional muon energy is subsumed (Int(vc: vmin) of (Emu vdsigma/dv)). The portion 
 of loss by v$>$vmin is treated as a stocastic process. However, the product from the 
 n.i itself is neglected \newline 
 3$\rightarrow$ the same as 2, but the n.i is explicitly included to produce a number of particles. 
 The n.i is treated as a photo-nucleus interaction. 

<<MuPr>>   integer

 TimeStructure should be T if Reverse 
= 0 and PathLimit is to be effective. 

<<PercentEnv>>   character*32

 assumed to exist and Cosmos tries to get the value of that env variable. 
 If the value is obtained, the \verb/%/ in \verb/%_/ or \verb/%./

 expressing a part of a file name is replaced by that value. 
 (default is blank and in that case the \verb/#/ is replaced by 
 the process number of the run). 

<<SucInt>>   integer 
 The number of successive interactions inside A is affected by this parameter.\newline 
 If $0\rightarrow$ old formula (before uv3.500) is used, which give rather 
 smaller number ($<Nsuc>$ in Air = 1.7 for 30 mb pp), \newline 
 if $1\rightarrow$ new one $<Nsuc>=2.2$ for 30 mb pp). \newline 
 Default is 0 (from V5.00 again).

 How to calculate deflection by the geomagnetic field. Let L be the distance 
 the particle travels. \newline 
 0$\rightarrow$Don't use RungeKutta method. Use the solution assuming the constant B, which 
 is exact if B is const. Since the particle path is made short, this is 
 enough for normal cases where particles are inside the atmosphere.(default) \newline 
 In every case below, if the particle height is $<$ 30km 
 (= cheight in ccomPathEnd.f), the same method as 0 is used. \newline 
 1$\rightarrow$ Use the Euler method. Time needed is 20\% more than the 0 case. 
 As B, use the value at L/2 point obtained by using the current direction. \newline 
 2$\rightarrow$ mixture of 1 and Runge-Kutta-Gill method. If gradient of B is large, RKG is 
 employed. This needs $\sim$4 times more cpu time than case of 1 when making a 
 cutoff table. The step size of RKG is $\sim$1/10 of the Lamore radius. \newline 
 3$\rightarrow$ The same as 2 but use the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method instead of RKG. 
 Step size is automattically adjusted ($\sim$1/20 $\sim$1/30 of Lamor radius) \newline 
 4$\rightarrow$ As a middle point, use the point obtained by assuming the constant B at 
 initial point. If grad B is still large, use RKG. \newline 
 5$\rightarrow$ The same as 4 but us RKF instead of RKG. \newline 
 6$\rightarrow$ Use always RKG \newline 
 7$\rightarrow$ Use always RKF. This takes very long time.(50 times of 0). \newline
